       " \"Hi everyone,\\n\\nI was referred here by someone at /r/investing for my question -- I'm a grad student in computational biology, so I have a lot of experience with modeling and what not. I'm looking to put together an algorithmic trading platform for betting spreads. It seems (in my mind) that if you find asset classes with very, very high correlation coefficients (&gt;0.9 or so [or alternatives &lt;-0.9 for anti-correlated equities]), that any spread beyond some historically defined pattern (probably on the order of 1-2% or so), there could be opportunities to trade the spread. Of course this is provided that the spread doesn't blow up, so I'd have to check for the statistical likelihood of that happening (as a function of other underlying variables like volatility and what not). \\n\\nHas anyone tried something like this? It seems a well-executed strategy could be prone to automation, which is what I'd like since I don't have a lot of time to dedicate on a daily basis for something like this. I imagine that spread opportunities won't happen every day, as I'm trying to base my trades off of finding patterns that are most likely going to lead to success (i.e. &gt;&gt;50% likelihood of paying off based on historical patterns), as I don't want to have to actively monitor the program as it trades beyond checking more than say once or twice a day. \\n\\nAnyway, does anyone have any experience with something like this? As a small example, take a look at this chart: http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2012/05/20120508_ESTSY.png\\n\\nYou can see that for a week the two assets were basically kissing each other, than the SPY blew up over USTs, but eventually the spread converged. Depending on how stringent I am and when I tell the program to bet the spread, a rough back of the napkin calculation makes me think that one can make something like 1-1.5% on the trade. \\n\\nThis should give you an idea of what I'm trying to find -- that when equities/asset classes that are normally very highly correlated become not so correlated. Ideally I'll only enter into assets that are liquid and have relatively tight bid/ask spreads so I don't lose all my profit that way. \\n\\nAnyway, thanks -- hope this leads to some interesting discussion. \",\n",

I'm looking to put together an algorithmic trading platform for betting spreads. It seems (in my mind) that if you find asset classes with very, very high correlation coefficients (&gt;0.9 or so [or alternatives &lt;-0.9 for anti-correlated equities]), that any spread beyond some historically defined pattern (probably on the order of 1-2% or so), there could be opportunities to trade the spread. Of course this is provided that the spread doesn't blow up, so I'd have to check for the statistical likelihood of that happening (as a function of other underlying variables like volatility and what not). \\n\\nHas anyone tried something like this? It seems a well-executed strategy could be prone to automation, which is what I'd like since I don't have a lot of time to dedicate on a daily basis for something like this. I imagine that spread opportunities won't happen every day, as I'm trying to base my trades off of finding patterns that are most likely going to lead to success (i.e. &gt;&gt;50% likelihood of paying off based on historical patterns), as I don't want to have to actively monitor the program as it trades beyond checking more than say once or twice a day. \\n\\nAnyway, does anyone have any experience with something like this? As a small example, take a look at this chart: http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2012/05/20120508_ESTSY.png\\n\\nYou can see that for a week the two assets were basically kissing each other, than the SPY blew up over USTs, but eventually the spread converged. Depending on how stringent I am and when I tell the program to bet the spread, a rough back of the napkin calculation makes me think that one can make something like 1-1.5% on the trade. \\n\\nThis should give you an idea of what I'm trying to find -- that when equities/asset classes that are normally very highly correlated become not so correlated. Ideally I'll only enter into assets that are liquid and have relatively tight bid/ask spreads so I don't lose all my profit that way. \\n\\nAnyway, thanks -- hope this leads to some interesting discussion. \",\n",

I have no doubt it will be historic.\\n\\nThat said, I\\'m struggling with putting together some concepts regarding FB\\'s introduction to the market and what effects it may have on the rest of the market.  I\\'m not intending to start drama or flame wars, but rather I\\'m hoping to converse with those on the other side of my opinion.  There\\'s no right or wrong, but rather why I *think* I\\'m right and why I *think* you\\'re wrong.  We\\'ll find out tomorrow either way.  \\n\\nOne of my favorite threads of my reddit lifetime is ironically from r/atheism over a year ago.  [These two dudes](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/cat9o/so_i_was_verbally_attacked_by_religious_nut_jobs/c0rcg6x) got involved in one of the most epic and controversial topics imaginable.  Yet each of the two sides made such incredible and articulate points with each of their responses that I found myself feeling stupid.  Because regardless of which side I was on, I felt that each argument was better than its counter argument.  I found myself agreeing with whoever\\'s argument I was reading at that second, only to change my mind after reading the next response.  I\\'m hoping to set that tone.\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nSo my opinion, plain and simple, is that FB\\'s IPO won\\'t have the kind of impact on related stocks as we\\'re hoping to see.  Without getting into detail, I feel this is the case because of two forces acting on the market pricing.\\n\\n1.  [Efficient Market Hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) (EMH)- this heavily debated concept revolves around the fact that markets (buyers and sellers) converge on a price based on the information is available.  Although there\\'s various levels of information transparency which affect prices differently, the concept is consistent.  As soon as market participants learn of new information, prices will be reflected.  The levels of transparency can vary: if a company experiences a high profile event i.e. files for bankrupcy, gets acquired, is granted FDA approval, or is questioned by David fucking Einhorn on a public conference call -- the drastic events should be reflected violently and immediately.  If the information is less available, then prices become less \"sticky\" (econ speak), meaning they won\\'t fluctuate as much, for example if someone has inside knowledge on JPM announcing billions of losses, then there may be [unusual activity](http://market-ticker.org/akcs-www?post=205824) in the options market, but overall the price changes once the news only after it hits the wire.\\n\\n2.  Markets are irrational.  This force is probably more powerful than the first one.  Because after all, people want more money and are forming their decisions in hopes to either make money or prevent losses.  This is also the reason why FB advocates predicting huge price fluctuations.  And FB has had one hell of a PR campaign to stir these emotions and pump irrationality.  So far, I\\'m hoping you\\'re all still with me.\\n\\nSo which one wins? Information or irrationality?  I don\\'t care to guess which one wins, but assume that they both play a factor.  Once information becomes public then people get to be irrational.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s for this reason, that I don\\'t really think tomorrow will be a big deal.  Because people will not wake up to new information, and consequently become irrational about something other than FB.  Unless its something new about Europe, or QE3, or Oil, or other new developments to which they add to both EMH and irrationality, then the prices are set.\\n\\nCase in point, FB made their plans to become public on [February 1, 2012](http://market-ticker.org/akcs-www?post=205824).  The moment information became public (supporting point 1) buyers became irrational and drove up the price of Zynga to its highest price hike of 17% since its history of being public (point 2).  \\n\\nSo unless new information is released tomorrow regarding firms, markets, acquisitions, sectors, economy, politics, products, international developments or other new information which was not previously publicly available today, then I think FB will have a historic and successful IPO (personally predicting it\\'ll end up in the $90s) but will be isolated from the rest of the market.\\n',\n",

       " 'I\\'ve been wanting to make a few write-ups on 2 topics that I became very interested in while learning about markets and whatnot: the VIX and ETFs (the latter of which I became somewhat obsessed with, especially of the *exotic* variety).  While putting my thoughts together it occurred to me that it would be fun to make it more of a package, after all learning about the VIX just by itself is pretty boring.  And thus the topic of the next round of write-ups would be about trading in general.  Obviously some of these topics are appropriate for a post-beginner audiences, since analogies have their limitations, this will be a step or two closer to reality than the (linked in sidebar) for beginners+.  Things you can expect in additional \"chapters\" in the trading series may include:\\n\\n* Understanding earnings-release bets (especially to those who bought naked options, guessed the direction of the move correctly, but lost money anyways and don\\'t understand why)\\n\\n* Technical Analysis\\n\\n* Markets.  Understand the relationship between stock markets, exchange rates,  treasury rates, interest rates, QE, precious metals, other asset classes, news, etc... In other words, a good all around basic understanding of how the various short to medium term (appropriate for trading) forces act on each other.  \\n\\n* FOREX\\n\\n* Specific options plays\\n\\n* ... ? \\n\\nThe last bullet point is there because I feel comfortable writing on certain topics, but I\\'m far from it with others, and therefore want to reach out to you for help putting these together.  If you have a particular expertise in any of these or other topics and you want to contribute, let me know.   \\n\\n***\\n\\nPre-Reqs: Basic understanding (meaning 100 level) of economics, statistics and options pricing.  Nothing too crazy, but if you\\'re wondering then here\\'s a test.  \\n\\n* You know what supply &amp; demand is and how they affect prices?\\n\\n* You know what a normal distribution curve looks like?\\n\\n* Have heard of Black–Scholes?\\n\\nIf you answered yes to the above 3 then you\\'re probably good to go, and if you bump into a topic or term you haven\\'t heard then you should be able to google it!  I\\'ve also seen questions popping up in IRC about basic options topics.  So if you\\'re still learning options, you may want to check out the write-ups linked in the side bar.  Lastly, I encourage all of you to look out for any errors here and point them out.  Thanks.\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\n**What is the VIX?**\\n\\nAffectionately known as the \"fear gauge,\" the VIX simply a statistic which measures aspects of options prices on the S&amp;P 500 index.  It\\'s is an extremely popular tool used by options traders mainly because the way options are priced, and more importantly what signals they send about sentiment.  If you\\'re a fan of Black-Scholes, you can call the VIX the aggregate implied volatility options of stocks in the S&amp;P 500.\\n\\nTo understand the VIX you don\\'t really need to understand complex options pricing models, because at the end of the day options prices are set by the market itself.  The sellers and buyers make up supply and demand, and are subsequently setting the price.  To be clear, VIX focuses specifically on the *extrinsic portion* of the options premiums.\\n\\nHere\\'s a mental exercise.  Let\\'s suppose you could freeze time (and therefore stock prices as well) yet you were able to trade options with others.  The resulting options prices would end up being priced at the equal to the intrinsic value.  Let\\'s say MSFT\\'s stock price was $30.00 and time/price was frozen, then nobody in their right mind would buy a call with a $31 strike price, because they know with **absolute certainty** that the option will expire worthless.  Inversely a $31 strike put would be going for exactly $1 because once again, they can trust that the option will be worth only $1 when it\\'s exercised -- and this effect can be observed at 3:59pm on every expiration Friday.  Now, if you un-pause  the clock, prices for both the call and put would go up mainly because of *uncertainty*.  That\\'s the uncertainty which is measured with pricing models.\\n\\nThis is where it gets interesting, because we can mathematically predict a portion of premiums using two quantitative variables: time and distance from underlying price.  It makes sense that uncertainty increases as both of these variables increase.  The only portion of the price which we can\\'t plug into the calculator, is what traders are thinking is going to happen in the future.  And traders\\' predictions are subjective and subject to emotion and uncertainty.  This effect can be observed when looking at options prices around earnings season, as traders are used to large price swings and therefore fear that after earnings are released their options will be worthless.  But premiums also go up around earnings because of folks like us, who want to profit, and we\\'re therefore more likely to pay a higher price for these options.  This uncertainty is called Implied Volatility (IV), not to be confused with observed volatility which is the result of what actually ends up happening to stock prices.\\n\\nIn short, the VIX attempts to quantify and take this uncertainty for each of the 500 stocks in the S&amp;P and put it into a number.  The higher the VIX, the higher the uncertainty.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Converting uncertainty into dollars**\\n\\nNow that we have a process to put a number on uncertainty, converting it into dollars is relatively simple:  **futures**.  Knowing the VIX price is akin to knowing a current score in a sports game, it has a numeric value and can\\'t be turned into money, but guessing its future value and putting money on it can.  For this reason you **can\\'t own shares of the VIX**, because it\\'s worthless just like the current score of a game.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Characteristics of the VIX**\\n\\n* Although VIX measures uncertainty in both price directions, SPY and VIX have an inverse correlation of about .8, which is why it\\'s dubbed a fear gauge.  This is also why it\\'s popular as a hedging tool.\\n\\n* If you [look at the price history](http://i.imgur.com/ozDCH.png), you\\'ll notice a few things.  First.  The price is constantly trying to return to the average (around 20).  This property is known as mean reversion.  You\\'ll also notice that it has never and can never be equal to zero, since there\\'s always uncertainty.\\n\\n* VIX options are european style, meaning they can\\'t be exercised prior to their expiration date.  Upon expiration they are settled as *cash in lieu* of shares, since shares don\\'t exist.  And finally, options expire on the third *Wednesday* of the month instead of Friday.\\n\\n* Spikes are huge.  nuff said.\\n\\n***\\n\\nI\\'d like to get into the VIX related ETFs, but I\\'ll wait until after I post about ETFs.\\n\\n***\\n\\nEdit: wow, I thought it was a longer post than it actually turned out to be.

       " '**Background** \\n\\nDuring IRC live chat today, AmericanPegasus made an appearance and was predictably critiqued about his style by many people (including myself) trying to enlighten him about the wonders of options.  In efforts to get him to experience the joys of trading these derivatives, I proposed to AmericanPegasus that I set aside $500 and allow him to control it using options.  Profits would be paypaled to him and losses would be absorbed by me.  AmericanPegasus cleverly returned fire with surprising wit, using my logic against me he countered the proposal I could not refuse.\\n\\n**The Duel**\\n\\nHere’s what we agreed to.  We will each set aside $500, and do as the other directs – except he’ll be directing me to buy penny stocks, and I’ll be directing him to trade options.  This is clever, because it gives us each firsthand experience of being in each other’s shoes, and naturally makes the transfer of profits unnecessary.  He will try to make the most money for me and I will try to make the most money for him.\\n\\n**The Rules**\\n\\n* AP is only allowed to direct me to buy **penny stocks**, and I can only directhim to buy **options** (no writing)\\n\\n* Duel starts **next week and lasts over a month**, as we each need time to setup for this.  It ends on Thursday June 31^st\\n\\n* We will agree on a way to instantly communicate with each other as best as possible, as well as provide windows of unavailability for the purposes of \"entering orders\"\\n\\n* Each of us has the right but not the obligation (see what I did there?), to **end the contest after 50%** of our money is lost (Edit: 50% defined as a percentage of our original investment, meaning $250 is all that is left)\\n\\n* At **least 1 trade** must be made by the end of the week, up to **unlimited trades**.  Because we both have many commission-free trades left in our accounts, they should not be a factor.  In the rare event that trades start eating up commissions, then commissions will come from the $500 and is up to the opponent to decide if a change in strategy is appropriate.  We\\'ll both be using cash accounts, so pattern day trading don\\'t rules apply.

Therefore, if the stock plummets the day before pdufa in anticipation of rejection, I'm going to play a small long position and sell the following day. The drug performed better than placebo and there are lacking options for treatment for sarcoma, so you never know what the FDA may do. I could see a CRL being soft, like some manufacturing issue, which means the drug won't be a completely write-off in the long term. Even in the event of a rejection, I don't see the stock staying down, it is a very minor part of the company. I will probably not buy if there is no dip though. In the end, I suspect the stock will quickly recover to pre-dip levels no matter the pdufa decision.\\n\\n**XNPT** has Horizant pdufa coming up on the 9th. Drug is already approved for Restless Leg Syndrome, and is being tried for use to deal with PHN. Glaxo is a partner here which lends some credibility towards the drug not being rejected based on domestic manufacturing concerns. Market size isn't proven enough to expect much movement in any direction on any pdufa decision. There has been good run-up to the pdufa which makes profit-taking very likely pre-pdufa. Based off efficacy, partnership, milestones, lack of manufacturing concern, I think it's worth playing long in the event of substantial profit-taking/dip prior to pdufa. However, the lack of proven sales projections makes me think that any gap-up will be short-lived. If rejected, it will be the result of a lack of substantial improvement in efficacy from already marketed drugs.\\n\\nIn both scenarios, you should immediately take profit in the event of approval or gap-up. As usual, do your own homework, this is just a notice.\",\n",
       " '[context](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tyb7h/were_putting_an_end_to_this_options_v_pennies/) for any newcomers.\\n\\nAnother exciting day.  Here’s the recap:\\n\\n**AmericanPegasus**\\n\\nAfter winning $160 dollars on the first day, AP became inspired by [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=E7zHF19n2qE#t=331s) which I mistakenly posted during live chat, and he subsequently left me with strict orders yesterday not to sell AGRT today under any circumstances.  Whether the price rose to $0.70 or fell to $0.30 I was to weather it through.  And there was plenty of weather.  Not even 5 minutes after open, the price dropped so hard that it erased all my profits from yesterday.  About an hour after that, the price jumped so high that I was up over $200.  At its peak, my account was worth over $850 which is 70% up from yesterday’s opening bell.  The result of this long day? AGRT ended up closing up at just over $0.01 netting me a [$17 profit](http://i.imgur.com/sGLvY.png).\\n\\nBut to top off this emotional roller coaster experience, were the treturous PsyOps Mr. Pegasus was playing on me.  Working hard to break me.  You’ll remember that the reason this whole thing is taking place, started from my efforts to lure traders/gamblers into using options.  Especially AmericanPegasus.  Well halfway through the day, to my horror, AP went all M. Night Shyamalan on me and inadvertently garnered the interest of other WSBers, enough to actually invest in this pump-a-dump madness.  WSB is now an agent of pump-a-dumping!\\n\\nI can safely say that my efforts (and possibly $500) to shed light on the wonders of options, is blowing up in my face.\\n\\n**jartek**\\n\\nMy approach moves were less exciting.  So after yesterday’s loss, and my conviction to win this thing, I’m taking a slightly safer approach.  Rather than trying to squeeze blood out of a rock, or taking unnecessary chances, I’ll constantly prowl the market for opportunities and will only make a move if I see something.  You can expect me to make some all-in style pounces but given that I have an entire month, there’s no need to rush.  I did, however take a small position:\\n\\n* 3x AA Oct $10 calls – he paid $0.33 for each of them and when the underlying price was just under $8.60\\n\\nBet reasoning? AA is a classic blue chip which has closed with a price under $8.60 a total of seven times since Jan-2010.  It’s not going anywhere and it’s at its 1% percentile trading range.  It’s also cheap enough for him to make a decent bet while leaving mostly in cash for when the time comes.  October because the low theta will preserve the premium while we wait for a good pop.  OTM because it’s cheap, had higher volume and tighter spreads.  As I told AP, it’s a slow cooker but a pretty sure thing.  The exact opposite of this penny business\\n\\n',\n",

So far, Ive realized a loss of $66 for AP and have him holding a position of $99 which leaves him a cash pile of $335 for me to work with.\\n\\n[9:30] Markets open with a decent downswing.  Something I've been anticipating based on market sentiment, economic news, the season, and Europe.  I watch the market and read some of the conversation in live chat regarding patterns and watching people's predictions, observations and even a few entry points.  I'm overall bearish on the day so I contemplate shorting SPY if I see an opportunity.\\n\\n[11:40] [I see an opportunity](http://i.imgur.com/HRyEC.png) after a double tap and reach out to AP.  While I wait, I look for the right put options.  Things I was considering was that I wanted to make this a quick day trade, as we start a new month tomorrow and have all sorts of uncertainties and so I decide to play it safe instead of taking additional risk by holding something overnight.  For day trades, high delta ITM options should be the weapon of choice, however they're also more expensive which I can't afford.

Shortly after, [while SPY was rising](http://i.imgur.com/MTeE8.png) and making him feel better but I made him feel better.\\n\\n    [12:11] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; But it's down!\\n    [12:11] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; NOooooooooooooooo\\n    [12:12] &lt;jartek_&gt; no, don't worry\\n    [12:12] &lt;jartek_&gt; no, don't worry\\n    [12:12] &lt;jartek_&gt; it may have to wait until 3pm too\\n    [12:12] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; What happens if it never triggers?\\n    [12:12] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; What kind of loss are we looking at?\\n    [12:12] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; If we exercise.\\n    [12:12] &lt;jartek_&gt; well, we're not exercising\\n    [12:12] &lt;jartek_&gt; we're selling them back to the market\\n    [12:22] &lt;jartek_&gt; no worries until after 3pm\\n    [12:22] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; Ok.  No worries until after 3 pm.  Got it\\n\\n*a few hours later* this is what we were facing.  By now, AP's (and my) puts are worth $0.30.  That's an additional $252 loss to his account, leaving him with only $120 in cash if we were to liquidate at this point.\\n\\n    [15:13] &lt;jartek_&gt; alright man, i'm going to have to make a tough call\\n    [15:14] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; Alright, I'm here, what's up.\\n\\nThe trooper and I had an active deliberation session about possible outcomes and the gravity of the implications I was facing.  After all, worst case scenario this is costing him 76% of his initial investment -- well past the $250 optional eject seat option built into the contest.  This is now serious.  \\n\\nShortly after, connection problems and desperation with trying to communicate with eachother even led to other WSBers trying to help out with the situation:\\n\\n    [15:46] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; Umm hello\\n    [15:46] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; Ok, i got disconnected for a minute there.\\n    [15:46] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; jartek, pm me.\\n    [15:47] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; jartek, I need some direction here; the markets close in 10 minutes!\\n    [15:47] * americanpegasus Quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)\\n    [15:47] &lt;americanpegasus_&gt; We holding?\\n    [15:47] * americanpegasus_ Quit (Client Quit)\\n    [15:47] &lt;jartek_&gt; did you get my pm?\\n    [15:48] &lt;jartek_&gt; here i'll try again\\n    [15:48] * americanpegasus has joined #wallstreetbets\\n    [15:48] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; I keep getting disconnected, wtf.\\n    [15:48] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; jartek, text me or pm me.\\n    [15:48] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; Market closes soon, need some instructions.\\n    [15:48] &lt;jartek_&gt; i'm sending you messages\\n    [15:50] &lt;Rex&gt; jartek_ you going to dump those puts before close?\\n\\nIntensity was at its peak.  At this point, [this is what the market was looking like](http://i.imgur.com/32Cc7.png).  After some intense back-and-fourth I made the executive decision to hold it overnight, much against my original intentions.  Decisions which I will share for those of you who are curious, but for the reasons of finishing this post I'll omit them.  AP bravely accepted his fate.\\n\\nAs you know, the markets dropped only minutes before that, raising the contract price back up to $0.66 before the market closed.  After that, after hours for SPY dropped the price an additional $0.22.  After factoring in time decay, the fact that tomorrow is the expiration date for this option, and its current projected price means that absolutely anything could happen.  By my calculations, AP is currently sitting on a loss around $30 from today's trade.  But this means nothing, as tomorrow there will surely be a change.  If SPY goes up, he'll make money on this epic bet otherwise it could prove disasterous.\\n\\nWelcome to /r/wallstreetbets\\n\\n*(to be continued...)*\\n\\n    \\n\",\n",

Now for the update.\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\n**AmericanPegasus**\\n\\nDid nothing.  AGRT [went up $0.5699](http://i.imgur.com/oaxF8.png), making me a daily profit of $52.47 or 7.53%.  He instructed me to do nothing for the weekend.  I want to point out two observations.\\n\\nFirst, I reported yesterday that I was up to ~$750 and today I went up another fifty bucks to a total of ~$750.  I have no idea how this is.  Perhaps I made a mistake yesterday but it\\'s unlikely, as I would have had to mess up all 3 metrics I reported (daily gain, %, total gain) to match up nicely.  Regrettably I can\\'t find the screenshot.  If anyone else has been following AGRT closely, or more importantly -- actually own it then feedback is appreciated.\\n\\nSecond, it sounds like AP is just sitting around doing nothing and watching his penny stocks go up.  Well in case you\\'re wondering, this isn\\'t the case.  I\\'m willing to bet the man puts more effort reading every penny stock tabloid known to man, he\\'s also invested in a more sophisticated market monitoring platform allowing him to see Level 2 data (which includes market maker activities).  And if you make the mistake of asking him why he\\'s doing what he\\'s doing, he\\'ll rattle on about it for an hour.  So say what you want about the effectiveness of his strategy, but I can tell you first hand that he puts in a valiant effort.  Also, there is plenty of action taking place behind the scenes.  Here\\'s a sample from today:\\n\\n    [10:15] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; Fuck it.  Sell AGRT for now.\\n    [10:15] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; Limit of 0.48\\n    [10:17] &lt;jartek&gt; k\\n    [10:18] &lt;jartek&gt; where\\'s the sell button?\\n    [10:18] &lt;americanpegasus&gt; Ahh, damnit.

That\\'s final.  I\\'m going back to bed.  \\n\\nIf you read carefully in the beginning of the exchange, it took me a whole 3 minutes looking for the SELL button before finally giving up and asking him for help.  This should serve as a clue as to how often I\\'ve sold on my new ETrade account under AP\\'s command. \\n\\n**jartek**\\n\\nI only placed one order pre-market open to sell his SPY puts with a $0.05 trailing stop on it.  His order was filled at $1.41 for a total of $564 -- this profited him $48 for each of his 4 puts.  However, when adding up his total gains under my direction I will only get credit for 3 of the puts -- the reason being is that the 4th put that he bought required he use his own money (outside of the $500) and in real life would have been rejected.  His intentions were good, but in the heat of the moment neither he or I realized that by raising the limit price to buy the options, he went over.  So in fairness I only get credit for 3.\\n\\nAs for me, I lucked out with not only this game, but I also had the same bet.  That bet was much riskier than I ever anticipated is not part of my playbook.  That said, I wanted to share the reason why I took it.  Simply put, there are barriers with trading the way we set this up. Barring 2 internet strangers swapping passwords to our freaking brokerage accounts, the next best thing is texting/PMing/IRCing eachother to try and get eachother\\'s attention.  Assuming we\\'re even available in the first place, it can take as long as 10 minutes to place orders which makes timing trades is a bad strategy.  This trade was a consequence of this effect.\\n\\nI also want to make a mention of how incredibly interesting and intense this \"contest\" is.  Yesterday I learned that the terrible feeling I get when I lose a bunch of money on a stupid mistake really sucks and can lead to hours of dwelling.  But losing someone else\\'s money comes nowhere close to that.  When I agreed to the duel, I mentally wrote off $500 from my books and figured I\\'d have a little fun.  But I didn\\'t consider the seriousness of actually playing with someone else\\'s money.  I\\'m going to continue looking for opportunities, taking some risks, and having fun but you probably won\\'t see me taking any all in bets on weeklies with a day left \\'till expiration!\\n\\nAP and I took a breather today and we\\'ll resume on Monday.  This thing\\'s a lot of fun, I hope you\\'re enjoying it as much as we are.  \\n',\n",

       " '[Context]( http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tyb7h/were_putting_an_end_to_this_options_v_pennies/) for new comers \\n\\nAfter an exciting first week of the contest with AP clearly taking a commanding lead right from the get-go, and me nearly wiping out the contest altogether, I’ve put some hard thoughts into switching up my game.  After all, there is absolutely no excuse for allowing a public display of any sort of penny stocks to come even close to the power of options.  With that in mind, I need to simultaneously shed light and create excitement showing first hand just how fun they can be to gamble with in order for me to consider this challenge a success.  This makes it double edged sword for me.\\n\\nAs any trader knows, success comes not only from making more than the others when things go your way, but also losing less when things go against you. And this is the theme of today’s events.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**AmericanPegasus**\\n\\nStarts the morning off with simple directions and expectations:\\n\\n    Going to be flying all day, landing in the late afternoon, will be out of cell service.\\n    Don’t make any moves on AGRT.  We will probably lose 5-10% today buy and run hard\\n    On Tuesday, so don’t panic.  Sorry I won’t be around to take contracts.  You can text me though\\n    If you want me to buy in the next few seconds or at the end of the day.\\n\\nI read this as:\\n\\n    “Don’t sell, you’ll lose 5%-10%.  Oh and you have a few seconds to make your move for the day.”\\n\\nA so new week begun.  \\n\\n**jartek**\\n\\nLucky for me I already had the trade picked out so I ninja-replied to him like a boss:\\n\\n    5x SDS July calls @22 $.45 if you can otherwise no worries.  \\n    Don’t raise the limit though.\\n\\nI’m not really expecting to sell this today so it’s a good trade, I’m thinking Thursday or Friday depending on how things go.  At this point, I get a phone call so I can’t text.  When I hang up I see the following msgs:\\n\\n    [10:42] They are 0.46.  Still a go?\\n    [10:42] Or put in a limit of 0.45 and hope.\\n    [10:43] They are 0.46.  Still a go?\\n    [10:45] Nm, taking off.  Now or never so I bought 5 for 0.46.  \\n    [10:45] BTW, u can use cells on planes.  Don’t hurt nuthin.\\n\\nAs you can see, AP and I will stop at nothing to make sure our trades go through.  Playing in this competition requires not only trading skills, but being able to face real-life adversity to get it done.  Whether it’s being limited to “a few seconds” to make crucial decisions, or to risk causing radio interference by emitting electro-magnetic fields shared by an aircraft that you’re about to take off on, we will get it done.\\n\\nBy the end of the day, SDS dropped to $.42 making it a -$20 loss or a 3.4% to his acct, and AGRT was [down $0.1049](http://i.imgur.com/EMvUh.png) -$137.94 loss or a 18.3% loss.  That’s right, I’m catching up!\\n\\n***\\n\\n##Standings##\\n\\n**AmericanPegasus**\\n    \\n    Cash Balance: $256.00\\n    Portfolio Value: $297.00\\n        3x AA Oct Calls @10: $87.00\\n        5x SDS Jul Calls @22: $210.00\\n    Account Value: $553.00 (+10.6%)\\n\\n**jartek**\\n\\n    Cash Balance: $0.30\\n    Portfolio Value: $611.48\\n        1,315x shares of AGRT: $611.48\\n    Account Value: $611.78 (+22.3%)\\n\\nThis puts me $58.78 behind AP.\\n',\n",

While it may sound boring to you, it is far from it.  AGRT is up and SDS is down; no communication either way can be compared to a game of chicken, or a staring game.  We're so confident in our positions -- whether they're winning or losing -- that there's no need to talk.  Think of it as the duel scenes in old clint eastwood movies where they [stare each other down with the *waaweee waaweee waaaaa* music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=13EUXqIwDkQ#t=7s).  Quite tense.\\n\\nSo, with that, I'll give you today's standings.  Keep in mind neither of our portfolio values has been liquidated, so account values can change in either direction at any moment as you've witnessed a few times during this early staged bout.

And so the battle continues to your delight and my dissent - here are the latest developments.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**AmericanPegaus**\\n\\nBefore I describe his moves I want to get into something a little bit personal.  The most prominent way AP and I communicate is by texting eachother.  Now I'm not the biggest fan of text, as I rely on chats/emails/calls/tweets/etc. for more effective communication.  And to illustrate the level of communication AP and I have had recently on this less-than-effective medium, I present this pic - a failed screenshot attempt on my android phone which I resolved by [taking an actual picture of it](http://i.imgur.com/bCZE8.png).  \\n\\nIn other words, don't mistake apparent visible inaction from apathy or lack of effort.  That said, today's instructions came the day before by letting me know he'd be somewhat inactive today after his text from last night:\\n\\n    [19:53] I'm [redacted] until 4 in the morning, and still recovering from the underbelly of [redacted]. \\n    See you tomorrow afternoon when I wake up\\n\\n\\n**jartek**\\n\\nBy the way AP, as far as I'm concerned your strategy is absolute [horse shit]( http://i.imgur.com/vaGxw.png).\\n\\nMarkets continue to test my patience, but I have a few possible plays.  First, I'm sticking to the AA trade unless there's significant developments.  Second, the SDS calls are nearing a critical decision: as you may know options decay over time, and leveraged ETFs do so as well (provided average conditions) - that said, I'm not trying to catch a falling knife as much as I'm waiting to kick it to AP right before it explodes.  Tomorrow will be an important day regarding that play. Lastly, I still have cash of his to work with and because we're at such a pivotal point, I'm likely to make it a last minute decision tomorrow.  And in all fairness to AP, here was one of my replies to his sleep-in comment:\\n\\n    [20:08] Also, Thursday night is poker night for me, so Friday is my sleep in day.  \\n    Let me know if u want to enter a trade.\\n\\nPoker night usually goes to at least 4am and I haven't heard back from AP, so let's hope AGRT holds up through noon tomorrow, or that I wake up to my txt alert sounds.\\n\\nRegarding the trades, we're both holding the same position as the last update.

A move that [reminded me](http://i.imgur.com/0L36O.png)  of Ben Affleck\\'s classic \"The Boiler Room.\"\\n\\nIt feels like there is indeed an imminent move on AP\\'s side, which would make this the second most significant development from his camp.  Incidentally, this would literally also make this his second actual development since we started.  \\n\\nOn a side note, I\\'m curious to see how things will play out if we do sell next week.  Last time I checked, AP and I had combined approximately $10k worth of AGRT which according to google finance is around 10% of the market cap/outstanding shares.  I also know that at least a couple of WSBers who are following this saga have bought AGRT which collectively makes redditors a large stakeholder.  This means that if we all sell at once, we single (err.. multiple) handedly can influence the stock price.  Now AP claims that these numbers are all tampered with, and given my limited knowledge of penny stocks and AP\\'s apparent mastery of them, I\\'d probably take his word for it.\\n\\n\\n**jartek**\\n\\nPivotal day for me even though I\\'m somewhat hungover and tired from previous night\\'s poker game.

I\\'m going for safer plays now after the whole weeklies incident, so I\\'m not really fazed by this loss since my new strategy involves averaging small losses with grand slams.

I am not giving up entirely, but as I said, need to take a multi-month (at the least) break to recuperate before I can even begin to consider playing with money again.\\n  \\nI will spend that time working on other pursuits of mine, and will still study the market and be participating in this board, so I\\'m not dead yet: just in cryostatis.  \\n  \\nThanks jartek for being a bro and playing a bad-ass high stakes game with me.

Well usually they get all excited thinking it\\'s a break-out (I don\\'t watch CNBC but I can imagine they\\'re in full bullish mode after 4 up days).

You probably also know that the VXX will decay over time because of daily rebalancing, but who wants to short something as volatile as the volatility index? So my hypothesis was that you could hedge a short position in VXX with a long position in VIX, after noting that VIX historically holds its value and VXX (like all ETF's which get rebalanced) loses value. Here's a graph of what i'm talking about: http://imgur.com/td8us \\n\\nYou can see that the VIX has held its value since 2010, while the VXX has lost 95% of its.

That has not happened, and instead, the PPS has taken an unprecedented dive to where it was last Monday. My GF's dad bought in at 8.2 and sold at 10 I think, and he doesn't trade biotech. I feel that there are plenty of uncertain hands in the 8s that can be shaken out before Wednesday. Those hands only came in long after ADCOM, they are bandwagoners. What those people hear now-a-days are commentators confusing the issues of post-CV studies and REMs (one is a post-approval study, the other are stringent guidelines for prescription), the apparent validity of vulvopathy signals justifying a REMs (despite it meeting requirement), and lack of efficacy (despite it meeting requirement).\\n\\nIgnoring the ignorance, just read the ADCOM transcript yourself @\\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/EndocrinologicandMetabolicDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM309522.pdf\\n\\nVoting comments start on p.348. One to consider is on p.382, former head of REMs, who voted yes and specified that a REMs should not be required.\\n\\nHeck, REMs isn't even on the radar on the briefing docs released prior to ADCOM: \\n\\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/EndocrinologicandMetabolicDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM303198.pdf\\n\\nArena cannot realistically develop another trial in the event of a CRL that could find signals that the completed trials have not already... For the signals the FDA requested, the ARNA satisfied all of the benchmarks. The sample sizes cannot get large enough to detect every conceivable side effect the panel think may arise post-approval. This is why post-approval studies are used, because they can detect such signals if they exist. Thus, in the event of a CRL, one must hope to see mention of a REMs, because there isn't anything that can be shown efficacy or risk wise before post-approval studies. A blunt CRL will return ARNA back to &lt;2 in short-order, and they will likely abandon lorquess and utilize the funds from their recent offering on their pipeline and lorphen (a combination of lorquess and phen). In the end, there needs to be a clinical justification for REMs, and, as far as I can see, there isn't one. The request for echocardiograms is a useless concern on part of the panel members, because a patient gets such an exam if signals arise from a routine stethoscope exam anyways. Such concern is predictable from PHDs who do not work day-to-day with patients.\\n\\nWhat will be expected in the event of an approval is extensive post-approval studies and a minimum of 12pps.\\n\\nSomething noted by one of the positive panel members is that preventing weight gain is also a very positive goal for anti-obesity drugs... Thus, the benchmark for having significant weight loss may be an unrealistic requirement for lorquess. If preventing weight gain in a high-risk population is the desired goal, surely patients need options that are not as risky as qnexa. In fact, when it boils down to it, responders of lorquess lost significant weight. Combined with the relatively low risk profile, all physicians are likely to prescribe lorquess before resorting to qnexa+extensive REMs.\\n\\nThe FDA needs this drug, and it will be politically very good for them to approve a safe anti-obesity drug in light of fen-phen. Note that the FDA was not uncertain or opposed to ARNA during ADCOM in any way, quite the contrary actually.\\n\\nDuring the past few months, any positive obesity news has had a positive effect on OREX, that may be a good proxy play.\\n\\nGood fucking luck for those who are holding cards during halt. Post-PDUFA plays? AMRN PGNX, and HZNP if there is a major correction in the near future... ARNA investors will spill over into other near-term biotech plays, especially if ARNA is approved.\\n\",\n",

       " \"[previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uxa8m/biotech_notice_for_july_plays/)\\n\\n**[PGNX] Update**\\n\\nBrief DD for you guys: http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/PGNX/1873613083x0x113126/6cc801fa-fe6d-42e6-87ec-8cb14c401679/roadshow.pdf\\n\\nPotential short-term catalysts: NDA filing of oral methelnaltrexone\\n\\nSet catalyst deadlines: **PDUFA by July 27th** for RELISTOR injection methelnaltrexone for non-cancer pain\\n\\nBrief summary of what drug does: Relieve constipation caused by opiods without impacting the performance of the pain killers.\\n\\nMy **opinion** it will likely be approved: RELISTOR has already been approved for palliative care. Manufacturing and delay concerns are zilch because it has already been delayed and they are still using SLXP as the partner. There are no alternative therapies that I know of and there have been no indication that efficacy or risk are inferior or worrisome. Since this is the same company that got RELISTOR approved in the first place, they are experienced with the FDA approval process.\\n\\nMy strategy: Dilution is possible, as the balance sheet shows that they should be green for another 6 months at least assuming expenses are constant (unlikely). However, they didn't offer more stocks 3 months ago so it's unlikely. When I last wrote about PGNX, stock was hovering over 8. It has since risen ~12.5% to 9.18, and I have a target profit taking PPS of 11. 11 PPS was the level where PGNX found itself pre-PDUFA before the 3 month delay. The only thing that has changed is that we are now closer to a potential announcement for another NDA, and a delay might be suggested by some that the FDA had not yet found anything grevious about the current drug up for approval. If we do not reach 11, it may be worth the risk to hold through PDUFA... All I can say for now is that I'm not likely to hold through PDUFA if I find myself at 11 PPS, and I will not likely reenter unless a substantial profit taking event occurs immediately prior to PDUFA. I would not expect a post-approval PPS to exceed 12 by a noticable margin, but you never know.\\n\\n**[HZNP] Update**\\n\\nSome notes: I don't have any cute presentations to link here. When I first posted about HZNP, stock was in the 4.6s... It has since risen nearly ~40% to 6.5s. This isn't to say that the run-up is over. Some of it can be attributed to 2 new marketing agreements that should expand American sales and begin marketing in Latin America/Asia, and the patent approval for the relevent drug being discussed here. There may be some risk involved for a substantial correction prior to the final runup towards PDUFA on July 26th, but if you were to ask yourself that question when I had bought in at around 4.9, it had already run up from 4 from the beginning of the month... Then some wsber asked the same question at 5.7s and now it's at 6.5... Expecting a correction can be costly, but if you have reason to believe it still has not reached an acceptable pre-PDUFA high, then perhaps it's worth the risk buying in on the high.\\n\\nSet catalyst deadlines: **PDUFA for July 26th** for Lodotra\\n\\nMy **opinion** for why it will likely be approved: LODOTRA has already been approved and has launched in Europe. Yes, the EMA is not the FDA, but it does give it a significant vote of confidence leading into the PDUFA because we can be that much less worried about manufacturing/labeling issues and some non-public severe risk signal. Mundipharm is the big partner in this, and they are also the ones involved with Europe's launch. HZNP has aleady recently previously achieved approval for another drug through the FDA, assuring us that they are experienced in the FDA NDA process. Efficacy was also superior to alternatives and placebo as shown in CAPTRA-1.\\n\\nBrief summary of what drug does: Reduces morning stiffness associated with R. arthritis. It is superior to alternatives because it does a controlled release.\\n\\nMy strategy: Dilution is possible, but the cash outflow is lower than PGNX and they have $80 million in cash on hand. Delay is also possible, but for what possible forseeable reason? I don't know.  I'm likely to stick with the run-up until a week or 2 before PDUFA. I can't say at this time if I'll buy back in prior to PDUFA, but it's possible if there is profit taking in the immediate period prior to PDUFA. Price target? I think double digits is very possible in light of all the recent developments.\\n\\n**Other notable plays**\\n\\nVVUS and AMRN. You can read a previous posting about my July plays for these 2 stocks, but I'm not as bullish on PDUFA with these 2 as I am with HZNP and PGNX. Both do have very real upsides, but, unlike AMRN, VVUS has a very real downside. AMRN's AMR101 and likely-to-be-approved patent for the expanded use of AMR101 for 10x the population are likely to be massive blockbusters. VVUS has adequately dealt with the FDA and all their concerns, but with the risk profile, I personally will not be holding through PDUFA... I am currently holding AMRN stocks, and have been since last Thursday, I think there is juice in this yet and with an official patent approval, this stock may yet rise even more on top of the recent pop.\\n\\n1 obesity PDUFA is enough for me. OREX did go up during ARNA's PDUFA, so it's worth keeping a buy order on hand in case of qnexa approval... Likewise, ARNA will most certainly go up if VVUS is rejected... Considering ARNA will not be halted, it may be worthwhile to be spamming refresh on VVUS's press page so you can immediately buy either/both OREX and ARNA during July 17th. However, just because OREX has behaved so fucking predictably at every positive obesity-related news, doesn't mean it will continue to do so. If you want in on VVUS or AMRN, the DD is on you... I can only say that run-ups are usually a given this far out on such blockbuster drugs, but you do run the risk of an early announcement or delay(for AMRN). Personally, I am bullish on both, just not bullish enough to risk sitting through either PDUFAs with my recent gains.\\n\\nVVUS PDUFA is July 17th, and AMRN PDUFA is July 26th.\\n\\nLastly, ONXX/LGND had a great ADCOM recently, and there PDUFA is July 27th. I have not done enough DD for this stock yet, but when I do, I'll make another post in &lt;week. With what little I know right now, I will **not** be holding through PDUFA, nor do I currently have any shares. With all the competition this drug faces, and the side effects involved, I'm just not comfortable right now to say that a delay is not likely, or that approval is likely.\\n\\n**ARNA**\\n\\nUnless you want to hold ARNA for 6+ months, I would think strongly about profit taking in the immediate future. With the DEA scheduling delay of 3-6+ months, that gives institutions plenty of time to wait for the PPS to drop before they increase their meager holds in this stock. If you want to hope for a buyout or late bull raid, I wish you the best, but that is not my strategy so I won't be doing that. On the other hand, the CEO was on CNBC today and gave a strong suggestion that the pill will be ~$3 a pop, 2x a day... which makes post-ADCOM projections of 12 pps even more conservative. However, with foresight that a DEA scheduling would be initiated, I would lower the 12pps to 11 or 10. I will be watching ARNA closely the next couple days to see if there is a run-up to account for this newly released pricing knowledge. The thing to remember here is that ARNA only makes 30% of the revenue... Think of ARNA as a biotech company with $4-6 billion market capital right now still 6+ months out from launch and no earnings releases yet and you can see why retail investors may not sit idly. Institutions will increase their holdings in this company, but it will take the better part of the year.\\n\\nCongratulations to everyone who held through PDUFA, but if you bought in 9+ for the first time and held through PDUFA, even 7+, you better have done a shit load of research otherwise your strategy is going to get you burned hardcore in the future. Otherwise, only people with a lot of diversification or a small position should be risking such plays. Don't be too greedy.\\n\\nIf anyone bought into SUPN despite my uncertain post regarding it, congratulations again.\\n\\nGL July! I personally hope massive profit taking takes place with ARNA so that they start filling up in other immediate biotech plays, which will make my run-up plays very profitable.\",\n",

Billion dollar pipeline. ** edit2: $500 million dollar market estimate based on old prices of $150 for treatment...

SLXP has another PDUFA On Sept 5, but I will not be reviewing it. ** edit**: Exited near 10, the calling of NAVB is too strong, GLTL.\\n\\n**AMRN position:** Closed, not that I think drug doesn\\'t deserve approval, only that I am uncomfortable holding a position this close to PDUFA on a non-extended date. Things like \"Commercial readiness to launch AMR101 through a strategic partner or by Amarin likely with third-party resources\" under 2012 goals concern me. Felt pressure from NVAB today with their volume increase and continued rise.

I would strongly suggest buying LGND immediately upon ONXX approval, it\\'s likely LGND will not be halted, it wasn\\'t during ADCOM... A stop buy order will do.\\n\\n**TLON PDUFA Aug 12:** Very high upside, comes with great risk. I will not be doing DD on this, it goes against my rule of not buying into a company that is pretty much bankcrupt at this point. That doesn\\'t mean the company\\'s current drug up for PDUFA and pipeline are not worthy of 100%+ returns from current levels, they are. A stock offering before PDUFA will make me reconsider. Someone was hired to head commercial operations late May. Delay was not related to trials by the FDA (possible manufacturing/labeling issues?).

Multiple myeloma remains \"uniformly fatal\", and the NDA is specific in pursuing approval as a last-resort line of therapy for those not responding to current treatment. It is not a cure.\\n\\nCapitsol is the mechanism for drug distribution. It has been approved multiple times with LGND, so capitsol-related concerns are not worthy for consideration.\\n\\n**Trial results:** Before I go into details, it\\'s worthwhile noting that the FDA has granted Expanded Access, allowing those with the greatest need access to the ongoing trials. This meant a targeted expansion to 500 patients, up from 250, for the applicable trials. Only those with at least 4 prior lines of therapies are eligible for the the applicable trials.\\n\\nAgreement with the FDA on an SPA.\\n\\nASPIRE P3 enrollment completed in Feb 2012, designed with the EMA. It is evaluating Kyprolis in combination with Revlimid. P1/2 did not find any significant toxicities and showed promising efficacy for patient population. ENDEAVOR P3 trial was recently initiated and that will compare it with Velcade directly. If ENDEAVOR is successful, it will likely mean, assuming Kyprolis is approved as a last line of defense in the upcoming PDUFA, that ONXX/LGND can submit another NDA to have Kyprolis used as a more front line of therapy.\\n\\n**Delay details:** Possible. Conference call post-advisory panel suggested (my suspicion, nothing more) a possibility that there are still labeling concerns with the FDA.\\n\\n**Stock offering details:**\\n\\nLigand has 19.7 shares outstanding, 33 million authorized. They had an offering Mar 26 2012 that raised $30 million http://www.researchviews.com/healthcare/pharma/womenshealth/DealReport.aspx?sector=Womens%20Health&amp;DealID=190327 . This was the only news release, so I\\'m unsure of authenticity. Dilution is very unlikely if it\\'s true.\\n\\nONXX has no chance of dilution for any fund-raising needs.\\n\\n**Manufacturing front:** Absolutely minimal concerns. Both LGND and ONXX have a history of dealing with the FDA and have established manufacturing lines pumping out FDA-approved products.\\n\\n**Competition:** There is an unmet need for therapy for those not responding to current lines of treatment, and Kypolis has demonstrated positive efficacy for those in need. It\\'s currently undergoing comparative trials to see if it can be used as a more primary method of treatment.\\n\\n**CRL scenarios:** Unlikely, but the FDA may uncharacteristically (with respect to products up for approval that deal with deadly diseases) request completion of P3 to confirm efficacy and quell safety concerns. A first time NDA for the drug always poses a concern, but given the severity of the disease, this concern may not be warranted.\\n\\n**Other:** \\n\\n$1-2.5 billion annual global sales opportunity(2016-2020), ONXX/LGND likely split royalties 90/10 if LGND\\'s past royalty figures are reliable indicators. 20k new patients annually, of which a total of 10-15k patients are refractory (refractory are the type of patients Kyprolis is being marketed for, and it\\'s not 10-15k of the 20k, but rather around 100k total patients). \\n\\nODAC Panel Jun 20 did very well, 11-0-1 approved. Question was: \"patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior lines of therapy that included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD)\". This attitude from the panel members and the willingness to extend Kyprolis under passionate use by the FDA suggests a willingness by the FDA to just throw more lines of therapy at the deadly problem if it can help those not responding to current lines of treatment. Safety concerns for Kyprolis are not substantial, nor are weak signals likely to trigger a CRL given the likely alternative, a quicker death.\\n\\n**PPS Target:** \\n\\nLGND: Before ODAC, LGND had a market capital of about $250 million, which is coincidentally pretty close to the 52-week low. With ~$30 million revenue, that puts P/E at around 7-8. Now P/E is closer to 11. Assuming similar royalty deals to their other products, we expect around 10% royalties. Combine this with a 2016 estimate of $1 billion sales, that puts 2016 estimate for Kyprolis sales at $100 million. That drives P/E down to ~3, assuming the rest of LGND\\'s marketed pipeline doesn\\'t grow. That would mean that LGND should be doubled by 2016 assuming the launch of Kyprolis goes as projected. With a randomly picked 20% annual growth, that puts 2013 sales at $57 million for Kyprolis. That would put LGND around $30 sometime in 2013 when earnings reports roll in. $27 by end of 2012 if they start selling this year. I think low-$20s is a low-estimate for post-approval price. 17% minimum upside from here IMO, and 60% would be a most optimistic result.\\n\\nONXX: Before ODAC, ONXX had a market capital of about $2.5 billion, around 30% higher than 52-week low. That puts P/E at around 10. Now P/E is closer to 13. Assume around 90% royalties. Combine this with a 2016 estimate of $1 billion sales, that puts 2016 estimate for Kyprolis sales at $900 million. With a randomly picked 20% annual growth, that puts 2013 sales at $520 million for Kyprolis. Using P/E of 7, that would put ONXX in the range of $88 sometime in 2013 when earnings reports roll in. $79 by year\\'s end if sales begin this year. Mid-70s sounds reasonable for post-approval price, but anything above $79 is excessive, and that\\'s only ~16% from now. It\\'s possible the market will decide P/E of 10 should stick, in which case 111 PPS is do-able, but this is probably a pipe dream..\\n\\n**What am I going to do?** Given my other obligations, I\\'m not likely to buy until we approach the period immediately prior to PDUFA, and it\\'s possible LGND won\\'t be halted if ONXX is. I would also require substantial profit taking to occur before buying in, similar to ARNA\\'s pre-PDUFA profit taking. I know I said I wouldn\\'t hold through PDUFA before, but I did say that was what I knew currently about the company, I know a fair bit more now. In terms of upside on PDUFA, LGND offers more.\\n\\n**What can be done?** LGND may still be a good run-up candidate to PDUFA if you think mid to high-20s is a decent target for approval.\\n\\n**Possible future postings**:\\n\\nSLXP crofelemer PDUFA Sept 5 Extended\\n\\nIRWD IBS/CC PDUFA early Sept Extended\\n\\nNPSP Gattex PDUFA Sept 30\\n\\nSUPN 804 PDUFA Oct\\n\\nSNTS UCERIS PDUFA Oct 16\\n\\nIPXL IPX066 PDUFA Oct 21\\n\\nUTHR reprostinil PDUFA Oct 27\\n\\nCRTX 080 PDUFA Oct 29\\n\\nALXA Adasuve PDUFA Dec\\n\\nAEGR lomitapide PDUFA Jan 5\\n\\nISIS Kynamro PDUFA Jan 29\\n\\nRPTP RP103 PDUFA Jan 30',\n",

HZNP enhances the effects of prednisone by having the release of the drug timed when the patient\\'s cytokine levels are elevated during the night.\\n\\n**Trial results:** \\n\\nCAPRA-2 is a P3 study that looks at how RAYOS does in combination with DMARD. 48% had 20% improvement in tender/swollen joint counts, while 20% had improvement with placebo+DMARD. 22% had 50% improvement vs 10%. 55% of RAYOS patients, vs 3% for placebo, experienced greater median relative reduction in the duration of morning stiffness compared to baseline at 12 weeks. Finally, significantly greater reductions in the severity of RA, fatique, and physical function were seen at 12 weeks.\\n\\nAdverse events were slightly lower in RAYOS group, 43% vs 49% in placebo. For other events like arthralgia, RA flare, nasopharyngitis, and headache, RAYOS patients continued to experience them at significantly lower rates than those treated with placebo.\\n\\nCAPRA-1 was a previous study done for the EMA, and it demonstrated efficacy just as good and better than immediate release prednisone, and risks significantly lower than placebo. This comparative trial\\'s pinnacle finding: \"At the conclusion of the three-month, double-blind phase, patients treated with LODOTRA showed a statistically significant reduction in morning stiffness duration compared to those in the IR prednisone treatment group (22.7 percent compared to 0.4 percent, respectively, mean relative change to baseline; p=0.045).\" More advantages can be seen when comparing the risks of RAYOS compared to IR-prednisone. Marginal improvement in disease activity score for RAYOS, and significant improvement in reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.\\n\\n**Delay details:** Already delayed, will not be again.\\n\\n**Stock offering details:** $50.8 million offering in Mar 2012. Future dilution supremely unlikely. With the cash at hand, HZNP is set.\\n\\n**Manufacturing front:** Still in a partnership with Mundipharm, who is the primary manufacturing agent distributing Lodotra (RAYOS) in Europe. Parternship has recently expanded to include Latin America and Asia. Cannot forsee any possible manufacturing concerns.\\n\\n**Competition:** IR predisine requires users to take the drug in the morning, while RAYOS can be taken  the previous day and will be activated during the patient\\'s peak pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Further advanges are noted under the trial category, but, on the other hand, IR-predisine is significantly cheaper. RAYOS users can be expected to annually spend +10x more, or $&lt;~350, for RAYOS than for generics. In the end, that isn\\'t asking much on an annual basis.\\n\\n**CRL scenarios:** Unlikely.\\n\\n**PPS Target:** 1.8 million people in the US suffer from RA, 50% of whom take prednisone or similar medication. A biotech analyst Nash projects $1.9M in US 2012, $16M in US 2013, and $106MM in 2016. That growth is pretty extreme, and it\\'s also a pretty extreme growth projection for Europe too. Predicting what the market may decide is a fair valuation prior to the growth projections being proven in future earnings reports is a tough game.\\n\\nThe P/E was about ~15 prior to this run-up, now it\\'s ~30. If the market has decided ~15 E is sufficient for DEUXIS projections + pipeline, perhaps they\\'ll feel the same way about RAYOS. With an estimated ~$2M in RAYOS 2012 sales and a PPS of 8, the P/E comes back down to ~15. PDUFA would be very dangerous. On the other hand, the 300M revenue projection in 2016 could be used to justify an imaginary P/E of 7 with 20% annual growth. This puts approval PPS at 30. Given 2011 growth supports a 50% projection, the may suggest a 12 PPS at 7 P/E.\\n\\n**What am I going to do?** Sell within 2 weeks, or close to 10-11 PPS. No reentry. The thing to keep in mind are the Latin America and Asian marketing expansions... This is a highly speculative play and should be handled with caution but it\\'s difficult to say where this PPS may end up.\\n\\n**What can be done?** Hope the analysts know what they are talking about and know how to price extreme growth into post-approval PPS. If they know what they are talking about, $10 is a conservative estimate, and should be an exit price for the run-up. Avoid PDUFA.\\n\\n**Possible future postings**:\\n\\nSLXP crofelemer PDUFA Sept 5 Extended\\n\\nIRWD IBS/CC PDUFA early Sept Extended\\n\\nNPSP Gattex PDUFA Sept 30\\n\\nSUPN 804 PDUFA Oct\\n\\nSNTS UCERIS PDUFA Oct 16\\n\\nIPXL IPX066 PDUFA Oct 21\\n\\nUTHR reprostinil PDUFA Oct 27\\n\\nCRTX 080 PDUFA Oct 29\\n\\nALXA Adasuve PDUFA Dec\\n\\nAEGR lomitapide PDUFA Jan 5\\n\\nISIS Kynamro PDUFA Jan 29\\n\\nRPTP RP103 PDUFA Jan 30',\n",
       " '**[PGNX/SLXP] July 27**\\n\\n**Company basics:**\\n\\nPGNX: $350M market capital, $2.2M vs $2M(\\'11) in quarterly revenue, R&amp;D expenses down $8.5M, and operation expenses were $12.1M vs $13.6M. Revenue increase was meager because there were no RELISTOR royalties in \\'11, RELISTOR being the only source of drug income, but RELISTOR profits did increase by 40% from the previous quarter. $59M in cash.\\n\\nSLXP: $3.23B market capital, $171M vs $106M(\\'11) in quarterly revenue, ~125M vs ~$100M(\\'11) in quarterly expenses. $665M in cash.\\n\\n**Product description:** RELISTOR is currently approved by the FDA and already being distributed by PGNX and SLXP worldwide. RELISTOR alleviates opiod-caused constipation without impacting their pain killing performance. Currently, it\\'s approved for use by those with advanced illnesses recieving palliative care. This upcoming PDUFA seeks to expand its market to include non-cancer patients. Both of these uses involve injection based methods of delivery.\\n\\n**Trial results:** \\n\\nThere was a tripling of adominable pains vs placebo, and doubling of nausea and dizziness. Further, there was an increase in flatulence and diarrhea, which could be construed as positive considering what RELISTOR is trying to do. There have been no cases of unexpected safety signals, nor have there been any signals suggesting that RELISTOR reduced the effectiveness of the opioids.\\n\\nP3 study found consistent results over monthly periods, and 34% of injections resulted in a bowel movement within 4 hours (vs 9.9% for placebo).\\n\\nThere have been no comparative studies done with alternative -methods- of allevatiating constipation, although I do not think there are any actual medication.\\n\\n**Delay details:** Already delayed, won\\'t be again. FDA did not request additional studies.\\n\\n**Stock offering details:**\\n\\nPGNX: 33.9M outstanding shares. With $59M in cash, a dilution is unlikely, however PGNX do have enough authorized stocks to make an offering.\\n\\nSLXP: 58M outstanding shares. With $665M in cash, a dilution is unlikely, especially considering the unlikelihood of rejection. They would be better suited to dilute post-approval.\\n\\n**Manufacturing front:** Minimal manufacturing concerns, since this new application is essentially seeking to expand the use of an already approved and marketed drug.\\n\\n**Competition:** Unknown.\\n\\n**CRL scenarios:** FDA requests a comparative study contrary all previous recommendatons and requests.\\n\\n**Other:** PGNX/SLXP is already currently in the process of filing an NDA for an oral based delivery of RELISTOR for non-cancer patients.\\n\\n**PPS Target:** \\n\\nPGNX: Upon approval, PGNX recieves $40M, and is eligible to recieve up to $200M in milestone payments. As it stands, PGNX will receive 15-19% royalties in the US, and I believe 60% worldwide. Currently, the P/E is about 35. Judging that the new expanded market for RELISTOR, assuming it\\'s approved, will likely increase their revenue by 1000%, it\\'s not terribly unreasonable to suggest that quarterly revenues will be at least $20M in a year following approval of the ORAL form, or a current P/E of 4. Adjusting to a P/E of 7, and we have a PPS of 18. However, what is up for approval is the injection based method of RELISTOR, not both the injection+oral method, so 18 is a realistic figure 6-12 months after the oral form is approved, but that hasn\\'t even had the NDA filed yet. The only recourse I can find in making a guesstimate at this point is to look at where PPS was heading back before it got delayed. It had reached 11 PPS, and with a delay, maybe you can see close to 12 PPS. Even now, given the high costs of RELISTOR and uncertain market penetration it will achieve with an injection-based method for alleviating constipation, I think 12 remains a generous post-approval price and much of the capital currently priced in for approval may be thanks to the milestone payments.\\n\\nSLXP: P/E is currently 4.7, considering SLXP is up for another PDUFA date in early Sept, I would say that SLXP could be worth 82.5 and that\\'s not even accounting for the upcoming PDUFA Jul 27. Given the extensive pipeline, it\\'s hard to suggest that injection-based RELISTOR for non-cancer patients is going to increase SLXP by +50% minimum on approval, but a rejection is hardly going to dent SLXP either. I would certainly recommend to /r/investing SLXP as a \"cheap stock\" if I bothered. I would hold through PDUFA with SLXP if I had to make a choice, but I do think you may find higher returns with SLXP on approval, maybe even with run-up, unless PGNX has a major correction prior to PDUFA.\\n\\n**What am I going to do?** I\\'ve already sold and sought cleaner pastures elsewhere. May consider SLXP for PDUFA.\\n\\n**What can be done?** Ride the PGNX run-up to 12 and make sure to get out if you find yourself close to PDUFA at such levels, a profit taking event is sure to happen. SLXP offers a pretty safe longer term investment strategy, especially in light of the crofelemer PDUFA that has an extended deadline at Sept 5, more details of that application to come at a later date.\\n\\n**Possible future postings**:\\n\\nSLXP crofelemer PDUFA Sept 5 Extended\\n\\nIRWD IBS/CC PDUFA early Sept Extended\\n\\nNPSP Gattex PDUFA Sept 30\\n\\nSUPN 804 PDUFA Oct\\n\\nSNTS UCERIS PDUFA Oct 16\\n\\nIPXL IPX066 PDUFA Oct 21\\n\\nUTHR reprostinil PDUFA Oct 27\\n\\nCRTX 080 PDUFA Oct 29\\n\\nALXA Adasuve PDUFA Dec\\n\\nAEGR lomitapide PDUFA Jan 5\\n\\nISIS Kynamro PDUFA Jan 29\\n\\nRPTP RP103 PDUFA Jan 30',\n",

The hotel did raise its full year earnings estimate. \\n\\nCurrently the shares are down about 2% after hours.\",\n",
       " \"JPM coming up, this one is a big one for a few reasons which I wanted to point out.        For starters, they will be the first big firm from the financial sector to report quarterly earnings, which it may set the tone for the others in this round.\\n\\nOf course they're also facing the regular scrutiny public companies have to go through each quarter - which tend to pay less attention to the actual results and more to what they were relative to the expectations.  This means they could have doubled growth, revenues, profits, etc... And could still suffer a blow to their stock price if they came below expectations.\\n\\nBut JPM has yet a third thing to worry about.  They have been in the spotlight of a scandal where a trader (dubbed the London Whale) lost billions of dollars on some bet.  After originally disclosing it, rumors came in that the loss could be even higher.  Well on Friday we get to learn what the losses actually have been (and will continue thru this year as they slowly unwind from the bet).  Great podcast regarding this - http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-10/credit-suisse-s-orenbuch-sees-hit-to-jpm-earnings-audio-.html\\n\\nLastly, their options are surprisingly cheap - with little implied volatility relative to what i would expect.    This can be good because the market is underestimating JPM's potential move, or it can be bad because I'm overestimating it.  I'll take some time later to come up with a play and post it tomorrow when I make it.  Personally I was going to try and stay with only a handful of earnings plays for this quarter - this one has my full attention.\\n\\nGood luck.\",\n",
       " \"It's hard to know when to stay long or sit in cash when it comes to biotech run-ups... Many of us who play biotech don't have the the bowl-o-matic bots, etc...\\n\\nIf you currently own the stock at the start of day, I would sell if you are trending down for the first minute or less of the market. Buy if it returns to when you sold (I like to use 0.5% above selling price), sell if it falls back to that threshold (or 0.5% below buying price), etc... In essence, you avoid as much loss as possible while not losing out on any gains towards your exit target. Even if you held overnight and it went through a big gap-down, you only sell if it trends down from opening. The 0.5% figure is so we don't end up getting owned by commissions on days where it is idling at your thresholds. I generally widen it to 1% as the day goes on.\\n\\nIf you own and it's trending down, sell, and buy if it returns to 0-0.5% above selling price.\\n\\nIf you don't own at start of day, buy if it's trending up, sell if it returns to when you bought (or 0.5% below buying price), etc... Likewise, only buy if it trended down initially then returned to the opening price.\\n\\nOnce the end of the day comes, I'll generally buy at closing regardless of what's going on (unless there is bad news or something). I've made a personal decision that I'll risk the gap-down. Another reason I buy is that I usually only own stocks that I'm optimistic on approval odds, so if news is released and approval has not been sufficiently priced in, I'd rather be long.\\n\\nOne exception to the rule with respect to gap-downs is that if the stock gaps-down, and at the start of day it is trending up and passes previous day close, I'll set my selling threshold to be the previous day close rather than the opening price.\\n\\nIf you have enough capital and commission isn't an issue, you could just buy/sell from opening much more aggressively, and have a smaller buffer-zone, eliminates subjectivity.\\n\\nUnderstand that gaps are areas of weak resistance, so there is little point in setting a buy/sell on the other end of the gap... It's best to avoid setting targets in that gap or on the losing end of it.\\n\\nThis strategy just reduces the stress of when we make the wrong decision, selling before a run-up and buying before a dip. The gains we initially aim for are good enough, greed will wear you down. Much of the losses incurred happen during market hours unless it is news-related losses... So if you do not own during those losing hours, you will inevitably find yourself avoiding those losses and finding yourself with more shares once the consolidation or correction period ends.\\n\\nIf you owned HZNP without making any moves since last Tuesday, you took in a lot of unnecessary losses. Obviously, this strategy may not be efficient for those with less capital invested, because buying/selling a couple times a day will eat too much into your profits. Further, there are some limitations for margin account users, so make sure you don't end up violating the pattern day trading rule or something.\\n\\nFrom Jul-4 on. This strategy's worst day for HZNP would be Jul-5 from the gap-down, then Jul-9 since it dropped sharply and didn't recover. It ends green on every other day.\\n\\nHZNP: You could end up 2-3% in the green since Jul-4, with about 8*commission in costs, rather than -10% assuming you did nothing. At the end of the month, after you're done with HZNP, that is 10% more to your final position.\\n\\nAMRN: You could end up down in commission costs since Jul-4, whilst doing nothing has you down at least -8%.\\n\\nYou'd likely be green NAVB.\\n\\nI would only enact this strategy after I experience 1 red day, but again that depends on how much capital you have invested and whether or not the commission is a concern. You could do it every day regardless of how the stock has been doing in previous days if you have enough capital. Consider that doing it every day means you'll be spending upwards of $300 minimum each month in commission.\\n\\nGiven that I work and have to leave my computer sometime between 10-1030am est, and do not return for about an hour or 2, I cannot use this strategy as effectively as I would like and bear raids make the possibility of using stops unthinkable. However, it can be worth the risk using stops if volume is low and it's not near start or end of day. I do find I have a better time reducing losses rather than trying to maximize daily gains. In the end, I end up maximizing my gains more than I could ever hope otherwise since I suck at timing, especially during multi-day trends.\",\n",

I wouldn\\'t go in on this one right now because the future is just too uncertain.  One of the reasons it took off was because it *used* to be **SWTR** and the promo company pulled a fast one and changed the ticker symbol overnight (didn\\'t even know you could do that) which locked some people into their shares somehow...?

When someone is offering you that much more for your shares less minutes later... you take it.  Turns out, I sold at the absolute high for the day: amazing luck.  I jumped in again at 0.62 cents later and sold at 0.65 cents.  Another win.  So my $4400 turned into $5700 in the blink of a morning.  Feels good man.  Now I\\'m out and waiting to see if another entry point forms on this, but it could be done already... we are in the middle of summer after all, a deadly time for pump and dumps.  \\n  \\nAlso, looking at some options in the meantime.

       " \"First of all I would like to thank jartek for the wonderful tutorial on options trading, it has certainly helped me a lot in understanding the basics of options. I have been looking at options spreads as an option trading strategy. I have a few questions with regards to the price dynamics of option spreads under various conditions. Let's take a bull call spread for example. A stock is trading for $19.50, and a call option of strike $19 has an asking price of $1.70 and a call option of strike $20 has a bid price of $1.30. I construct a bull call spread by buying a $19 call option and writing a $20 call option, for a net debit of $40.00. My maximum loss is thus $40.00 but my maximum gain is $60.00, for a risk:reward ratio of 1.25:1.\\n\\n1. Is it correct to say that for bull call spreads, I am sacrificing potential upside when the stock price goes slightly above $20.00 as well as lower delta and gamma (as the positive delta of the $19 call option is reduced by the negative delta of the $20 call option) for minimal theta and vega (as the theta and vega cancels out leaving a very small difference, assuming similar implied volatility)? In that case, I don't have to be concerned about volatility spikes/crashes as well as time decay as compared to owning a call option only?\\n\\n2. As theta decay of a call option is at its maximum when the stock price is near its strike, is the bull call spread at maximum positive theta when the stock price is near $20.00, and at maximum negative theta at $19.00? In that case, if I am confident that the stock price will continue rising and staying above $20.00, I should hold the bull call spread and earn positive theta until expiration? Similarly, if the stock price falls to $19.00 and may stay below $19.00, I should consider closing the position before the negative theta kills the value of the spread?\\n\\n3. The implied volatility of the call options may be different. What are the implications with regards to vega for the bull call spread with different implied volatilities?\\n\\n4. Lastly, how do you choose the underlying stock on which to purchase an option spread on? Do you use screeners and look for stocks with the best max gain to max loss (with high open interest), or you just look for opportunities on the stocks that you are familiar with? Basically I am not too sure on the specifics on executing an option trading strategy.\\n\\nThanks again for any help that you may give a novice like me!\",\n",

I'm gambling here, so I only grab 2 CRM NOV 150.00 Calls. \\n\\nAfter doing this I see Jim Cramer was looking to play the Nov 145 Calls. I'm thinking this should be enough evidence to sell out of my position, but I don't. I wanted to see how this would play rolling into mid-October. I had a feeling this play, if it works, might take some time to develop. \\n\\nSo far it ain't pretty. I'm down just under 35%, and I set my max loss at 45%. Now that I'm getting close to that I'm feeling like I'm on the tilt and I'll just let it right to expiration as Salesforce announces earnings in Nov. I'm thinking about covering with a Nov 150 Put. I just wanted to see what the rest of you traders thought? Thanks. \",\n",

If we try to distribute the additional 2.26B evenly, we get $2.27B (just a coincidence that it's so close). If we cap the size of the market before Zohydro is introduced, market potential is scaled down to $1.6B\\n\\nOR\\n\\n27% (% from size of Hydrocodone market in IR market) of the current ER market size is $1.4B\\n\\nLet's make it an even 1.5B. Add in the estimated 1% projected potential IR market from their presentation, and we have **$1.75B market potential**\\n\\n---\\n\\nI am going to use a conservative 6 years for this drug to reach market potential, and, as it stands as a solo company, I expect a growth rate between 50-100%. Currently, Samuval, their marketed drug, has had a growth rate ranging from 40-100% depending on where your initial position is. In fact, they may meet their expected market potential for Samuval by the end of the 4th year since approval. I feel that this establishes ZGNXs potential to maintain at least a 50% growth rate for Zohydro (for the rookies, a 100% growth rate over 6 years would be worse). Thus, like my [HEB analysis](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/109rxj/heb_potential/c6bntj5), we will determine PPS estimates using **50% growth over 6 years**. I am disregarding 4 year for 50% growth or lower because of the competitive market this drug faces, and to provide a more conservative approach. **With a market capital size for the drug of $10.5B after 6 years using P/E of 6**, we calculate the following:\\n\\nWith big established partner, 20% growth over 6 years means a potential run-up high of $28/share (For example, 20% royalties brings this to $5.6/share). 30% growth over 6 years means $17/share. Finally, for kicks, using a rough Samuval progression estimate, 100% growth over 4 years brings the PPS to $5.2 (Their progression may be closer to 50% over 4 years once we know the results of 2013, but using that for Zohydro estimate will give us a high estimate that I don't want to conclude with anyways). **My most reasonable conservative estimate comes from 50% growth over 6 years, and that brings us to $7.3/share**. All these estimates are only 80% of the expected post-approval price and ONLY indicate Zohydro ER portion of the total share price.\\n\\nFinally, We expect about a conservative $40M in sales for 2012 for Samuval, and maybe $50M in 2013. At P/E of 6, and minimal deficit, that brings our base share price to about $2.7/share...\\n\\nSo, as you can see, this stock still has practically no value priced in for Zohydro ER. **This stock can see a high of $10/share, or at least $7.9/share, during the run-up.** Be reminded that ZGNX is now more experienced after Samuval development, and they may have managed 50% over 4 years... We would be approaching $17/share with expectations of a repeat performance.\\n\\n**PDUFA is March 1st**, and if they find a big partner in the mean time, do not panic, multiply the royalties with the 20% or 30% figure from this post :D\\n\\nThis company only currently has cash to last to mid-2013. The current burn rate is about $10M, and they currently have $40-45M cash. Dilution prior to PDUFA is not all that likely given the recent offering in July, but you can be certain of an offering post-PDUFA, or post-ADCOM if the company plays it safe (they should). However, an offering is hardly a concern for the stock price. Another $65M fund raising effort done tomorrow would only require 25M shares, and dilute the stock 20%. At double the current stock value, only 10%. In the scheme of things, it's neglible.\\n\\nWarning: What can throw my entire analysis for a wild ride is the lack of data on generic vs brand costs and how that may impact sales given that Zohydro ER isn't going to be priced like a cheap generic. My estimate on market potential ended up suggesting each prescription would cost about $25, I wonder if that's complete garbage :)\\n\\n**So, in conclusion, we may see $10/share by March if they continue to be going at it solo. This stock really hasn't started the run-up at all, so getting in now assures you absorb almost all of the run-up. I would not recommend holding through any catalyst dates without doing extensive clinical DD. I definitely won't be overexposed if I hold some shares through a catalyst in the event that I find the price is heavily underpriced. Linearly estimated, the stock, if we follow the conservative estimate, shouldn't exceed $4.24 end of Oct, $5.68 end of Nov, $7.12 end of Dec, etc...** I may be colossally overestimating if my bullshit calculator is way off, so please critique it or offer other methods/sources...\\n\\nClinical DD is up to you!\",\n",

       " \"Revised PPS target in comments below.\\n\\nCurrent PPS: $1.8\\n\\nHad a nice opening today, figured I'd do some preliminary fact-finding. DCTH is going to approval of their treatment targeting melanoma metastasis to liver.\\n\\n50% result in death (rough estimate on number of metastasis from melanoma)\\n\\n95% of 2610 eye cancers = 2480\\n\\n20% of 21700 skin cancers = 4340\\n\\n2.5 * treatment\\n\\n15000/treatment\\n\\n320M market potential highend if all cancers metastasized (and thus death rate inevitably 100%).\\n\\nThis figure does not factor in the number of melenoma incidences that actually metastasize to the liver. Considering melanoma metastasis is generally fatal, using a rough estimate of the number of metastasis from the number of melenoma-related deaths estimates that about 50% actually metastasize. Which would knock the number down to 160M.\\n\\nThus, I think the 160M market potential is a reasonable conservative estimate for the US market at the targeted indication for this current NDA. At a blunt estimate of 30% or 50% growth over 6 years, we vary between 80-200M market value in the near-term for this indication in the USA.\\n\\nThe market decided ~326M was good for the EU approval, but currently has the company valued at 123M. There targeted indication was all liver cancers.\\n\\n~66000 cases of liver cancer in EU if the rates are similar to US. A 326M valuation suggests that the market expects about ~50% of those incidences to be treated by CHEMOSTAT (depending on growth rate used at 6 P/E). The rate will certainly be even higher amongst metastasis patients in the US target population since their prognosis is dire and treatments limited.\\n\\nIn any case, an additional 160M market (80-200M market valuation) in the US after 6 years should not do insane things to the company's near-term valuation. If the FDA approves this indication, it's assumed the other indications will follow with more relative ease and thus some of that anticipation is being factored in.\\n\\nOver &gt;5 years, there should be a lot of development into other organs and other markets. A ball-park estimate of about 150k in the US, extrapolated to the forseeable markets, and there is the most optimal projection of 750k patients (vs the near-term current ~70k). So, there is a tremendous potential in the pipeline of this company, but don't expect to see them come to fruition for another 10 years at least.\\n\\nI hastily put this together in light of a nice opening on DCTH today, with expected upcoming NDA acceptance by the FDA in the near-future (overdue if you ask me). So, for my type of play, this preliminary research tells me I'm not interested, maybe you are. It may have had the nice opening today in anticipation that an NDA rejection (like it did in the recent past for this company) would have happened already (last time it took a month, and it's been more than 1.5 months this time).\\n\\nIf you have issues with how I came up with these numbers, do ask :) I'm not a professional.\\n\\nTarget price for run-up high: Rough estimated base market value due to EU growth for next 3-6 months @ 25% + US approval @ 80% = 155M + 140M = 295M or **$4.49/share**. Does not factor in any Asia developments or heightened expectations for more approved indications in US if approved in early Feb for the melanoma metastasis to liver indication by FDA.\",\n",

       " \"Current PPS of $4.28. Pre-PDUFA target of $5.0 (Feb 24). This target is mostly a valuation of Hepslav + pipeline 3+ years ago. This company has some pretty big partners in the pipeline with some big milestone payment possibilities. I can't put a price on it.\\n\\nEngerix-B and Twinrix are inferior in terms of efficacy and safety, annual sales of 700M\\n\\nRecombivax HB annual sales are about 400M, targets weaker people which suggests the drug has an inferior benefit-risk ratio to Engerix-B/Twinrix which can be used with healthy people.\\n\\nDiabetes population of 19 million people, of which 25% are above the age of 65. The &lt;65 group has recently been targeted for the vaccine due to the susceptibility towards liver damage. So, approximately 15 million people are being targetted by Heb B vaccines. ~900k are diagnosed every year. Considering HPV infects about 0.3% of the population, and those infected suffer liver damage which can harm diabetics more significantly, I think, considering the price of Energix-B is $345, doctors will routinely prescribe the vaccine. Let's disregard the number of currently infected individuals and say that 900k will be vaccinated each year. A ~300M annual market size in the States.\\n\\nIn total, the global market size for HPV vaccine is $1.1B, and $300M for diabetics in USA. For a total of $1.4B. For strictly US market, about 40% of the HPV market is in the States, for a refined total of $740M domestic market size.\\n\\nAssuming DVAX captures the entire market, that comes to post-approval estimate of $1.4B, or nearly 100% upside. However, that's too optimistic. Considering Heplisav was compared to Engerix-B in the P3 trials, it's sufficient to say that, as Engerix-B is being phased out over mercurcy concerns, that Heplisav will capture at least half of that $700M global market. As for Recombivax, which targets high risk populations (suggesting that the benefit-risk analysis made treatment of healthy persons with Recombivax unadvisible), I'd wager that 50% capture is too low, but let's not get to cocky. So, in summary, with 50% of the Engerix/Twinrix+Recombivax market, that's $370M in domestic sales for non-diabetic population. With the diabetic market, that's $520M market potential in the States, and $850M market potential worldwide (including States).\\n\\nThis does not factor in the strength of the pipeline, which, considering that the stock went from $6 to ~$1 in '08 when the FDA halted clinical development, suggests that the rest of the pipeline accounts for at least ~$223M of the current market capital if that pipeline has grown 30% annually. (I've assumed approximately 20-25M shares of dilution, which includes the recent 17.5M, if this is too low, let me know, I hate digging up old shit).\\n\\nIn total, a decent market valuation for DVAX 6 years from now, assuming minimal development in the rest of the pipeline, would be at least $6B (P/E of 6). This comes to about $2.1B post-approval assuming 20% growth. Given the level of competition it faces (there are lots of generics, which are used much more in foreign markets), I think 30-50% is much more reasonable, especially considering the diabetic population is a new target. 30% growth would mean a $1.3B valuation, and obviously 50% is no good because that comes to a lower market capital than what it currently resides... Considering the high institutional ownership of this stock, I don't think they are idiots.\\n\\nPicking the 30% growth rate, assuming EU and US launches as scheduled, the $1.3B valuation post-approval seems reasonable. The domestic market alone would justify a $920M market valuation post-approval. EU launch will probably occur 6-12 months after US launch.\\n\\nAt 80% approval odds on PDUFA, that's $1B and $740M respectively pre-PDUFA. Considering both submissions are being done within a year of eachother, I think the global market estimate is acceptable.\\n\\nAt the current PPS, this suggests a pre-PDUFA high of $5.6. A more reasonable est. would be $5 if we consider that the EU market will be launched at a later date. PDUFA date is Feb 24th, ADCOM is next month, delay possibility is there. Considering that Heblisav SHOULD completely take over the Heb B market eventually, I think my estimate of 50% capture is bearish enough to justify 30% growth rate. \\n\\nTo the contrary, if this stock were priced a lot lower, I would have used a 50% growth rate, which may be more likely considering this is the company's first drug commericalization effort, this eliminates any foreseeable upside no matter how much of the market DVAX captures. As a result, I'm not playing this stock, but with the high institutional ownership, and the tendency of them to use lower growth models (especially considering they have more facts on hand with regards to DVAX's commericalization efforts), it may be worth the risk if you keep a close eye on things.

But it got slammed on the ADCOM, and I care not to see whether or not the panel members were being fair or not. This stock is under valued IMO, but that's probably the result of the huge debt they took on by acquiring CRTX 080 (the lixivaptan drug)... and look where it got them, an ADCOM rejection. PDUFA is Oct 29.\\n\\nEXEL, preliminary fact finding determines that by 2018 the Carb drug will be making about 500M in sales through the thyroid and prostate indication. The market has probably decided that a thyroid indication approval makes the prostate indication approval inevitable. This is further compounded by the fact that the 500M sales figure, at 20% growth, gets us 990M market valuation post-approval, or 790M market valuation pre-PDUFA. Sounds reasonably close to the current market valuation, and explains why EXEL has been a POS stock since the stock offering... It was too high and a run up was building for an adcom that ended up being cancelled.\\n\\nEither way, if we find EXEL at a discount below 790M market valuation, it may be worthwhile to play the catalyst if you're a risk taker. Understand that a rejection unrelated to manufacturing concerns could indefinitely destroy this company and become a penny stock. However, the probability of such a rejection is remote, especially considering the benefit-risk profile is just as good, if not marginally superior, to a competitor that was approved earlier this year. Further, by cancelling the ADCOM, it presents 3 obvious conclusion: The risk was too much, the efficacy too inferior, or the results were simply stupendous. The former 2 options are unlikely given the fact that the marginally worse or equivalent competitor drug was approved, also without an adcom. Further, that competitor was approved for use for those unable to undergo surgery, a specific requirement absent from EXEL's drug. Finally, the drug still has the green light for compassionate use in an on-going trial... If something shitty had come up, that allowance should have been revoked.\\n\\nSo, in all likelihood, a rejection will be manufacturing related, setting us back 6-12 months to about 3.80-3.90 (that's the 6 month PPS retreat point, I'll offset the other 6 months with the fact that the prostate NDA submission date would not be delayed by the thyroid indication is delay). That should be the bottom, which means 28% bottom, and a 20% top, if we run up to 790M before PDUFA. The R:R gets progressively better for longs the less we run-up. However, with the cancellation of the ADCOM and the prettiness of the clinical results, I'd wager approval odds are above 80%, which makes a long play far more sane. 80% isn't 100%, look at how NAVB fared.\\n\\nThe company does have about 150M cash now, but that's likely to be fueling the massive clinical trials they have planned for the rest of their pipeline, which is all based on the same drug.

B vaccine. \\n\\nPreliminary opinion of the clinical trials tells me it should get a stellar vote given its superiority over the competition, but briefing docs can always reveal major red flags that weren't disclosed before. Entering post-briefing docs, even after the initial gap-up (if it's still below the 5s in this case), can be a good strategy on high-institutional stocks.\\n\\nI may or may not entertain myself this week by getting involved, it depends on the briefing docs and how quickly I can get in. I will not be holding through ADCOM under any circumstances. The last short interest report showed about 10% short position in the stock, so you're going to need to be quick if the briefing docs are good.\\n\\n**Edit:** ADCOM is actually Thursday\",\n",

       " \"I wouldn't hold EXEL, I think approval is priced in already... This makes for a great opportunity to buy in on bear raids since the buying pressure will be very weak from here on up. Hype can change all that, and in such an event, PDUFA will be a short's game. Unfortunately, with the high institutional ownership, it's doubtful any bear raid will plummet sufficiently enough to justify the risk of it simply being a profit-taking event (and thus not rebound). Nevertheless, keep an eye on this in the first 30mins for each day this week, and buy in if it ever drops 20% from the high on no news. If the stock moves up a significant amount before PDUFA, I would be hesitant to buy on any apparent bear raids, as it is more likely a profit taking event.\\n\\nACAD is due to release their P3 results this week for Parkinson's Psychosis. Maybe it will be announced on the weekend, maybe it gets delayed. This is the second time ACAD is doing a P3 trial, as their first one had a large placebo response. I will leave it up to you to decide whether or not ACAD has taken the necessary steps to minimize placebo response this time around... If they have met the minimal expectations for efficacy and significance, this stock may settle at high 3s at minimum, preferably low-4s. These values are my own, and are discounting post-approval price by 80% (PDUFA approval odds given great P3 results) and 20% (a year discounted given that the NDA hasn't even gotten a submission date planned yet) respectively. The more significant and efficacious, the more likely the market will expect that the psychosis drug will be proven efficacious in P3 trials for both Alzheimer's and Schizophrenia's psychosis. The Parkinson's indication alone isn't even worth $2/share with good P3 results, much of the meat is in the other 2 indications which are in P2 phases. Even with a good P3 result this week, ACAD will still be required to complete a confirmatory trial. Given the high percentage of patients rolling over to the other ACAD trials, enrollment will be swift and the trial duration is a matter of weeks. It's due to begin in early 2013. As a result, I fully expect an NDA submission within 6 months, and so a PDUFA date in 2013 would not be unthinkable. If ACAD doesn't break $3 on good results, at least we will have a good opportunity &gt;6 months from now.\\n\\nALXA has continued to rise from when I last mentioned it here as a buy at $3.90s. It's currently at $5.40s, and I'm expecting it to continue to rise until high $6s at minimum. Approval price is in the $8s. Approval should happen, assuming management isn't self-destructive. They got a CRL earlier this year, and apparently the issues, manufacturing related, have been resolved. Things are really coming together for ALXA, all things considered, with the EU approval decision imminent as well.\\n\\nDCTH bottomed out at $1 after it got the announcement that the PDUFA is going to be later than expected, so it now makes for a good multiple month long position at this level. $4s a target here.\\n\\nBoth PATH and ZGNX seem to have given up on dropping... ZGNX has an ADCOM on Dec 7th. ADCOM will be excessively risky for ZGNX, do not hold through it IMO. I don't know what to make of PATH, with their bizarre fund-raising I'm not quite sure how many shares will be outstanding in the future. It's at least 30M, if not &gt;55M.\\n\\nHEB continues to languish, some credit goes to the ATM for that. It may be facing quite a gap day come ADCOM, but, at minimum, it should see a move into the mid-1s before stock is halted. I'm still expecting $4s, fully diluted, before PDUFA, with a good ADCOM vote. Disclaimer: I'm not factoring in possible partnerships, because I have no idea what sort of royalties HEB would be looking for, considering that they've gone this far without much assistance and they've spent most of their funds on upgrading their manufacturing facility. 30% would be somewhat robbery, but a minimum benchmark. If we say 30% royalties, then 20% growth rate would be used and ROW markets would need to be factored in... Ultimately, we end up at around the same PPS.\\n\\nThat's all for now, GL!\",\n",

There is a real possibility ALXA will be in mid-$6s before PDUFA, and if approved, could be as high as $12, but no lower than $8s (depends on EU). This is the third NDA, 2 previous rejections. Latest rejection was manufacturing related and only happened this year. Further, ALXA expects EU approval Dec 14, 7 days before PDFUA on the 21st... Unless management have been lying about the extent of the FDA issues with them from the previous CRL, then ALXA still presents a great opportunity at these prices.\\n\\nZGNX is not likely to penetrate $3 before ADCOM unless docs are very good, because the topic of abuse is going to be hot on the panel discussion. This may be one of those times that the FDA does not take the recommendation of the ADCOM if the ADCOM rejects ZGNX. So an entry into ZGNX may be more advisable after docs, exit before ADCOM, and then re-enter after ADCOM. If ADCOM vote is positive, I expect the stock to nearly double.\\n\\nHEB still languishing, dilution doing a good job keeping it down.

Regardless, there is more certainty of approval this time around, and so a $5.5 should have been a benchmark minimum.

       " \"ARNA, ACAD, SRPT, etc... the pattern emerges.\\n\\nMany think that this is evidence of a bubble or faulty investor/trader valuations.\\n\\nIn reality, it's a balance between upside to fair value, catalyst dumpers, cover vs short, and buyers.\\n\\nWhat's happening is that a short squeeze is triggered when the gap-up magnitude passes a certain threshold depending on the aforementioned factors.\\n\\nWhen catalyst dumpers sell their shares on good news when approval is not priced in, most of those shares are being dumped on shorts buying their shares back to cover. Then there are some longs who want to make a quick trade if they see in the first minute that the price keeps going up (there is a short squeeze beginning). There are also some shorts who will double down. Many shorts will cover quickly, then reopen a short position when the squeeze ends.\\n\\nIf there is a significant gap-up close to or more than 100%, shorts are very, very, likely to cover. Further, if the short interest is sizable, larger than the daily volume, then it is less likely to be swallowed by the catalyst dumpers and, thus, any squeeze is not likely to provide resistance to downward movement or trigger an upward climb.\\n\\nWith huge gap-ups, you've got the entire short interest scrambling for shares, but there are only so many shares available, and that's how we see a fair value for ACAD being low $4s end up at low $7s in the pre-market. That's how ARNA ends up over $12 on PDUFA. Longs see a squeeze in effect and then just sit there watching the price go up, which cuts into the available shares for shorts to cover with, and the price keeps going up.\\n\\nBut the closer the approval is priced in, which, in many cases, the market has priced in approval to at least 80% or more, then the less likely a short squeeze really does anything. Further, the catalyst dumpers may very well drive the stock down after good news if there isn't enough upside potential.\\n\\nCatalysts events coming up like HEB, KERX, and ALXA, all have the potential to trigger a massive squeeze. Sure, HEB may only have 5 million shares shorted going into ADCOM (with respect to # outstanding), but that's more than the daily volume... If you think HEB should be high $2s on a good ADCOM, then with 5 million shares short, HEB may hit high $3s for a bit (this PPS estimate is using 10% capture, 30% royalty, a worst-case scenario estimate, still +500% upside even then upon a PDUFA approval). KERX has a massive short interest, that may be big guns leveraging for better financing or buyout deals, who knows, but with 1M daily volume, then some of the +50% fair value projections on good news on the 23rd may end up being closer to 100% returns the day-of (if KERX remains near current PPS).\\n\\nCatalysts for biotech can be real funky because of this, that's why it's essential you have a good method for valuation, to make sure you don't get caught with your pants down if approval is priced in or there isn't much upside. The catalyst dumpers (like us) is a force to be reckoned with. But once you hit that certain gap-up threshold, depending on the short interest and buyer interest, that short squeeze can be fucking epic, and that's when big bucks are made on catalysts. That's why it's important to take note of the short squeeze when you're trying to use past performances to anticipate the future, don't let the short squeeze fool you into thinking that the stock was, briefly, at the fair value, it wasn't.\",\n",

But if you look a little closer (and know about options) you\\'ll notice something strange.\\n\\nThe dude bought **400 out of the money calls that expire in two weeks** (that\\'s ~400x100 shares worth of leverage).

       " \"My friend sent me some thoughts and just wanted to bounce his ideas to the Reddit community. He's a very sharp trader with some pretty extensive experience in trading options. \\n\\n\\n\\n1.  The market is at a really high price.  It should sell off soon - when I'm not sure, but when it does, it could sell of 5%-10%.  I think that there's a chance it could happen between now and mid-march, but for sure by mid-may.  I envision the next 2 months as some down, then likely one more rally, then a sustained sell off after April\\n2.  Vix is really low, put options right now on SPY is historically cheap.  So if and when the market does sell off, there would be a good amount of increase in value from vix increasing.\\n3.  AAPL might have ended it's steep correction.  AAPL has already rallied 10%, could it give back some or a lot of that gain?  Or will it rip significantly higher like it did when it rallied 80 bucks in November?  Even if we do get a similar % gain, that'd be around a 65 dollar gain.\\n4.  May options on AAPL is not reflecting the earnings volatility premium.  At current prices, the 600 strike call would still trade for 1.45 come April.  There are risks though.  \\nRisk 1 = AAPL stock might drop.  \\nRisk 2 = if market falls significantly and has a 10% correctly, how well will AAPL handle that.  I can imagine a scenario that since AAPL has significantly underperformed the market, it will instead outperform the market in the coming weeks - but this is definitely not a high probability imagination.  \\nRisk 3 = it's possible that the implied volatility does not get as high as it was back in January, which is what I was using as a basis to estimate May calls when it is April.  I've ordered option data for 1/2012, 4/2012/, 7/2012, 10/2012, and 1/2013 so I can analyze more instances of IV during the month before earnings for the options expiring after earnings.\\n5.  If I do trade SPY puts instead of AAPL calls, what should my strategy be?  \\n\\n\\nShould I use 5% of my capital each week and hope for a multi-week break?  The risk is that the market might drop for 1 week, and then rally back, or drop for 2 weeks then rally back.  And if I don't manage my positions prudently, I could get into a lot of trouble trying to do this trade now.\\n\\nShould I buy a calendar spread with perhaps long May and short March or April?  The risk is that the market might go on a 10% correctly, in which case my position would not do well.\\n\\nApril expiration is perhaps too short as I am expecting a collapse AFTER April \\n\\nMay expiration - I could buy a 150-140 vertical spread for 2.3.  The pro for this is that I can wait for May for it to drop below 150.  if it goes on a 10% correctly, that would take us back to 140 and this position would 4x.  I could even cash out of initial investment if we get a downdraft and vix spikes, I could probably short the 140-130 for 2 if we get a 3% sell off and vix spikes a bit (making the position a butterfly).  That why I would only be 20% at risk with still similar potential to get 10 bucks.  I can also even buy some AAPL then..  \\n\\nLooking at prices, if SPY were to rally 3 more dollars, the value of this spread would drop to 1.7, or a 25% drop for the worst case scenario of market continuing to rally to SPY 155.  But even if it does get to 155, I think a 5-10% correct from that point is highly likely.  A 5% correction would drop it to 147.5 and would give me the chance to exit via shorting the 140-130s.  \\n\\nSimilar to the above, I can just buy 150 outright for 3.6.  If market drops and vix spike, i can probably sell the 140s for 2.5?, and get another 2 for shorting the 140-130s and get all my money back. But if the market continues to rally to 155 during the next week, the value would drop to 2.2 possibly.  That would put the unrealized loss to almost 40% and feel pretty uncomfortable.\\n\\nI can buy a May butterfly 150-140-130 for 1.5 now.  The downside to this is that if vix spikes, it actually works against a butterfly.  And I have no opportunity to cash out equity which the other trades provided. \",\n",

In doing so I find my model fairly accurately predicts if gold is over/under valued. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/TsMF03Z) Anything above 0 means gold is undervalued, below 0 is overvalued. I purposely cut off a lot of the graph for personal reasons.\\n\\nThis doesn't necessarily mean gold will go up, it means that gold is under performing by about 23% compared to the USD.

Made a bunch of money but not as much as I'm about to outline (because of slippage) as an example of how this worked.  For example, the most this setup would cost would have been $26.66 (without slippage or commissions) on 2/15, and less each day after that, down to $15.5 on the open yesterday (2/22, and it closed at 14.30).  Day-trading from open to close netted around $10.32, or about 38 percent without slippage or commissions.\\n\\nWithout the slippage and commissions, a short-and-hold would have netted $12.36, about 46 percent for the week, but I have no idea what the protective stop would be for a short-and-hold and I suspect day-trading reduces the risk considerably.  Certainly, the day-trading kept me from going insane, which is what I used to do trading options.\\n\\nAny suggestions or observations on how dumb (or maybe smart) this has been would be appreciated.\\n\\n**EDIT 2/26/13 -- Didn't make this bet today so of course it was worth about 13 percent on the day trade.

My, my, my...**\\n\\n[**THE AAPL SHORT STRADDLE - MARCH 1 EXPIRATION**](http://screencast.com/t/xEviKVSmAmK4)\\n\\n**EDIT 3/2/13 -- Wrapping up this strategy... This short straddle made money on five of the past six trading days, losing only yesterday when AAPL went into free fall.  Yesterday's loss was roughly the equivalent of one of the other 5 days gain so no big deal.  Overall gain was about 29 percent on money committed to the trade.**\\n\\n**However, there are moving targets here that helped make the trades profitable.  It was a day trade each day, put on at the open and covered at the close, which for better or worse eliminated overnight risk. Also, since it was a day trade, I scaled down each day to the nearest AAPL strike, that is from 450 to 445 and finally to 435. Also mid-week I switched from the March 1 weekly expiration to the March 8 weekly expiration.  Had I stayed with the March 1 450 straddle throughout, yesterday's loss would have wiped out the week's gain and then some (on AAPL's sharp decline Friday, calls flat-lined and puts went through the roof). So, as far as I'm concerned, I think the keys to winners here are the day trade adjustments and the time decay in the weekly options.**\\n\\n**Been good week this week.

       " \"Here's part 2 of what looks to be at least 6 parts :/\\n\\n**ACHN 3102/Sovaprevir P2 9/30/2013**\\n\\nPeak sales estimate: $2.7B by '21\\n\\nUseful links: http://seekingalpha.com/article/961571-now-could-be-the-time-to-speculate-on-achillion-pharmaceuticals\\n\\nTargets: Currently $8.15. $12s by Sept '13, $26s w/ good P2 results and P3 initiation.\\n\\nPossible position: Watch for it to hit low $7s, then buy. Sell close to $9. If it doesn't get down to low $7s, but breaks over $10 and we're around June '13, buy and sell close to $12.\\n\\nNotes: There are some intermediate catalysts in 2Q as well, so be cautious. There isn't much pipeline to help stock if trial fails. Plenty of money has been raised, which would offer a bottom in case trial fails, but not much. Dilution odds are minimal in '13.\\n\\n**ACOR Ampyra P2 6/30/2013**\\n\\nPeak sales estimate: $900M by '21\\n\\nUseful links: JPMorgan 2013 presentation can be found on their website\\n\\nTargets: Currently $30.4. After P2 results, if good, aim for $40s which should come before end of P3 trials.\\n\\nPossible position: There isn't a sane long position one can take until P2 trials are completed. I bet shorts win either way on a catalyst trade, so keep an eye out for a dead cat bounce.\\n\\nNotes: Ampyra has been approved for another target population but to treat similar issues, which bodes well for current P2 trials. Lots of revenue in the company, so dilution concerns are minimal. Downside in case of trial failure is also minimized by revenue stream, but stock would still take a -50% haircut.\\n\\n**ALNY ALN-TTR02 P2 6/30/2013**\\n\\nPeak sales estimate: 10k * 35% market capture * 140k competitor price = $490M by '21\\n\\nTargets: Currently $23.74. $26s with good P2 result and when P3 is upon them.\\n\\nPossible position: Good results priced in a little too much, will hurt buying pressure for any long trade. If stock drops to $20 and it gets hyped, maybe a multi-day trade. I think shorts are on the right side of this catalyst regardless of good or bad results, so I'll be eyeing for a dead cat bounce.\\n\\nNotes: Lots going on in this company, Hyper. indication and rest of pipeline and recent cash injection would provide support in $10-16 range if trial fails.\\n\\n**ANAC Tavaborole PDUFA ~12/31/2013-6/30/2014**\\n\\nPeak sales estimate: $300M by '20 for Tavaborole. $500M for 2728/2898 by '22\\n\\nTargets: Currently $3.94. Little hard to work with since 2728/2898 are the heavyweights and are in P2 for the most part, but upper-$5s if Tava approved sounds reasonable assuming 2728/2898 pipeline hasn't transitioned into P3s yet, otherwise we would be looking at $8s. So, I think $4s is a reasonable target pre-PDUFA.\\n\\nPossible position: Assuming one holds long enough, I think a decent long position can be made anytime. Stocks had a decent run on final Tava P3 results recently, I'd let that die down. I think low-$3s will return unless 2898/2728 starts hitting the wire with frequency. If one buys in low-$3s, I think there isn't much resistance on a year-long position until $5s. Mid-$4s has some historical value so that may be better target for a shorter trade.\\n\\nNotes: I think Tavaborole approval is a likely, but in the event that it's not, if 2898/2728 is still in P2 land, expect -50% haircut w/ the worst of CRLs. Dilution is likely to happen to finance pipeline and commercial developments, 25% would be worst case scenario I think, 10-15% dilution was their last one. Assuming dilution inevitable, adjust my targets for them pre-emptively. In the scheme of things, dilution shouldn't deter a long position, but should surely encourage one when it happens.\\n\\n**BDSI BEMA Buphrenorphine-Naloxone PDUFA ~12/31/2013-6/30/2014**\\n\\nPeak sales estimate: $300M by '20. Quite a subjective estimate given the competitive marketplace for pain killers.\\n\\nTargets: Currently $3.78. Upper-$4s pre-PDUFA, $7s if approved. (assuming dilution isn't too much if it happens)\\n\\nPossible position: Recent downward trajectory. I think low-$3s will make for a good entry, mid-$4s good exit.\\n\\nNotes: Delayed Onsolis revenue doesn't help if PDUFA is rejected. Assuming they do a raise during '13, and BEMA Buprenorphine(the other one) is still not done P3, I think a very bad CRL will, at most, bring stock down to high $1s. There is a reasonable possibility that given the incomplete P3s, FDA may decide to hold out until they are completed before approving... The reason company is moving forward anyways is because the primary drug in this product is already widely used and approved, it's the delivery and surrounding technology that's new.\\n\\n**CHTP Northera PDUFA ~12/30/2013**\\n\\nPeak sales estimate: $375M in '20. (Company thinks it can be done by '17-'18)\\n\\nTargets: Currently $1.69. $3s pre-PDUFA, ~$9 if approved.\\n\\nPossible position: Long position anytime really if you are targeting $3s. Otherwise I would wait a while and then target $2. I think $1.5 is going to hold up unless dilution happens soon. Dilution will happen sometime this year regardless, probably for ~$30M at least. At $2 would be about 20-25% dilution, and worse if it's done lower than that. Maybe they get a loan. An offering would be a good entry point though.\\n\\n**CRIS Erivedge for BBC+Pancreatic P2 6/30/2013**\\n\\nPeak sales estimate: $150M royalties by '21\\n\\nTargets: Currently $3.08. $4s with good P2 data and P3 upon them.\\n\\nPossible position: It bounced off $2.75 resistance region. I don't think there is much more room here to run, but if it does and results come out, there may be a sell-off.\\n\\nNotes: They are on a loan program, and they are getting milestone payments. Dilution odds are minimal. Erivedge is approved for another similar indication in BBC, so market is pricing P2 success quite strongly for P2 trials. Failure of Pancreatic trial would hurt stock significantly, failure of both Pancreatic+BBC will justify -50% haircut at least.\\n\\n**DRTX Dalbavancin PDUFA ~12/31/2013-6/30/2014**\\n\\nPeak sales estimate: $126M by '20 (another subjective estimate from me)\\n\\nTargets: Currently $8.28. $9s pre-PDUFA, $12s if approved\\n\\nPossible position: Probably return to mid-$7s before PDUFA. Shorter exit target of $8.2s, and a longer exit target in low-$9s.\\n\\nNotes: Dilution unlikely. Drug has bad clinical history with pfizer, and the clinical need for this type of out-patient brand is unproven, which is why I'm going to say I'm to say that my entry target is likely, but my longer exit target isn't.\\n\\n**Other stocks of note during this period and likely be in later posts: ARRY CYTR ALKS**\",\n",

My question is, assuming a full utilization of the 4x margin power, is that 1% on the purchasing power, or 1% on the cash balance?

       " \"Hi All. \\n\\nJust wanted to take some time to go over some information regarding (AA) Alcoa and their upcoming earnings and long-term outlook.\\n\\nFirst of all, AA is the first Dow member to report their earnings, 4/8/13 at 5:00pm. Consensus EPS remains at $0.08/share, with $0.12 and $.04 topping and bottoming the estimates. During this quarter, aluminum prices have continued to decrease, even as markets have generally improved. Aluminum and some other metals react more to macro events rather than supply/demand, thus driving prices down much more erratically as news of fiscal struggles in U.S. and Europe continued to plague headlines. AA has clearly felt the repercussions of these reductions.\\n\\nAA's support remains around $8.10, with resistance at $8.70. With most analysts bearish for this quarters earnings, I believe we can expect to see earnings in-line or below estimates. I can see AA opening under $8.00 on Tuesday.\\n\\nThat said, estimates for EPS growth in the coming quarters/years remains strong. For the next 3 quarters of 2013, estimates consistently average around $0.14-$0.15. That said, the range of estimate is much wider, and earnings **will** hinge upon global economic growth and news. There fundamentals are otherwise strong-mediocre, and they've taken steps to increase efficiency in their productions. \\n\\nThe market seems very bearish on AA right now. It has consistently lagged behind the rest of the Dow and has delivered sub-par results. I do believe that in the next few years, we will see economic growth globally, and a slow turnaround for AA.\\n\\nDisclosure: I am long AA, and this just some very basic opining of some very basic metrics. I don't have a good enough grasp of security analysis to fully analyze the stock, so I'd love to hear WSB's analysis. \",\n",

       " 'Here\\'s the basic info from this quarter:\\n\\nAlcoa, Inc. (NYSE: AA) reported Q1 adjusted **EPS of $0.11**, versus the analyst estimate of** $0.08**. Revs of **$5.83** billion, versus the consensus of **$5.89** billion.\\n\\nAdjusted EPS compares with $0.10 reported in the same period last year.\\n\\nAlcoa said the stronger results were driven by \"continued productivity improvements across all businesses, better mix, and higher volumes in the downstream business.\" Higher pension and planned maintenance partially offset gains.\\n\\nCash on hand at the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion and Alcoa hit record-low 28 days of working capital for the quarter.\\n\\nLooking ahead, Alcoa affirms expectations for **7 percent global aluminum growth in FY13**, though supply pressure caused the company to cut its surplus projection for aluminum \"from 535,000 metric tons in the fourth quarter to 155,000 metric tons this quarter, driven by curtailments.\"\\n\\nOn Alba, Alcoa said it was actively negotiating with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to reach a resolution of their investigations of the Alba matter.\" Currently, no agreement has been reached.\\n\\n\"This was a strong quarter led by record profitability in our downstream business, improved results in our midstream business, and remarkable upstream performance in the face of weak metal prices,” commented Chairman and CEO Klaus Kleinfeld. “Our mid and downstream businesses now account for 72 percent of our total after-tax operating income while our upstream business continues to move down the cost curve.\"\\n\\nShares are down 0.6 percent in late trading Monday.\\n\\n____________________________________________________________\\n\\nSurprising that EPS came out ahead of estimates, low aluminum prices plagued the markets throughout this quarter, but this was reflected in the shortcomings in revenue not EPS. The lack of economic stimulus throughout Europe and US and China\\'s slowed growth, as well as an increase in aluminum stockpiles, seemed to contribute to today\\'s moderate results. \\n\\nLooking forward, what can we expect from Alcoa? Well, the company continues to increase it\\'s efficiency and expects higher demand, as automobiles, aerospace, etc, pursue more fuel efficient vehicles made out of aluminum. In my opinion, AA hasn\\'t gotten the treatment it deserves from the street. The company remains productive and profitable, and has recently only been hindered by low aluminum prices. Given that economic recovery is slowly becoming apparent, I believe we can expect to see a 5-10% bump in AA\\'s share price over the next 18 months. Of course, this completely banks on economic recovery, but honestly, we should see some sort of recovery globally within the next 5 years. I am in this for the long run, and thus have no worries that this quarter\\'s revenue came slightly under targets.\\n\\nLet me know what you guys think.',\n",

A partnership announcement within 3-6 months would be expected, which would propel the stock up to $2.5.\\n\\nIf DARA doesn't get ODD, I think it'll be a good buy at whatever low it finds itself. The upside from a partnership is still quite good, between $1.3-$2.5, but whether or not a partnership comes without an ODD can only be answered once the next trial for KRN5500 begins. DARA will want a partnership before they start the next trial, and so it'll be a sign that there likely won't be a partnership for another 1-2 years if they start phase 2b without one. Depending how quickly they want to start the next trial without a partner will determine whether or not the stock sees further dilution + warrants. They could potentially finance the next trial without dilution if enough revenue comes in from their other drugs, but that would delay the start of the next trial quite some time.\\n\\nIn the long run, waiting for ODD approval, or a partnership announcement, may provide the opportunity to start a long-term position in the stock. Without either, you risk being in the stock too long given the increased risk of further dilution, and risk of lacking volume vs warrant flipping.\\n\\nRegardless of the fundamentals situation, the stock could be a good trade if it bounces off $0.76 or the 52-wk low.

A responsible trader would have broken even on EXAS, and maybe even made money.

The weekly MACD looks like it might be in the early stages of bottoming out, the daily MACD looks like it's beginning to turn up.

The daily MACD looks to be close to confirming the shorter term uptrend.  The volume looks OK but not quite reassuring.  This could set up nicely into a longer term uptrend but still a little early to tell.\\n\\n\\nJRCC - This one is trending already and the daily RSI is showing over bought.  The daily MACD confirmed the short term uptrend in early May.  The weekly RSI is still below over bought territory and the weekly MACD has yet to confirm the longer term uptrend but looks like it will.

The big question is whether or not the increased trial duration is due to the control arm over-performing, which could hinder the survival rate endpoints for VICL.

This catalyst is P3 results for CF infection sufferers. The trial is being run against the standard treatment TOBI, meaning that if the trial shows Arikace as being superior to the comparator arm, it means a substantial market opportunity will be acquired. TOBI has sales of $400M in a $500-600M market, the other remaining market may simply be those who were originally on TOBI but have lost its efficacy due to long term use. Arikace, apparently, has more resistance to losing efficacy in the long term. In the end, if it shows superiority, Arikace should easily capture $200M. That indication alone is worth $12 if we use $200M assumption. That may easily be a significant underestimation depending on the upcoming data release.\\n\\nFurther, Arikace is being trialed for 2 more indications, one of which is for NTM. If Arikace gets $200M in the CF population, then if NTM gets approved (where there are no competitors and Arikace would have exclusivity due to Orphan status) it would most likely garner well over $300M, probably $400M in sales. For the time being, if we price that indication with to-market odds of 10%, that corresponds to almost $3. P2 results for the NTM indication are due by year end.\\n\\nThere is another indication in equally sized population as the NTM indication, but that trial has not begun, so we won't bother with it. Analysts project $600M in sales by 2020, I'm more or less projecting that by 2021.\\n\\nIn conclusion, base price + NTM + CF would be &gt;$16 w/ good results. If we were to upgrades NTM to-market odds from 10% to 30%, then with enough steam the market may try for $20s w/ good CF results, but not likely.\\n\\n---\\n\\nRMTI\\n\\nAssumptions are 55% of the $25M in Calcitrol sales and $162M in SFP sales.\\n\\nInterestingly, the endpoint for the P3 was in fact met in P2. The P2 was more-or-less a dose-ranging study so you can't take the data as gospel but it does somewhat validate the bull argument that the P3 will meet the primary endpoint. A couple months ago, RMTI reported the results of a market study which was purposed to see how much the experimental drug can reduce dosing length. This is determined by running the primary and placebo arm such that both arms must maintain similar hemoglobin levels... If a patient's level got too low, they are taken off... What was found in the market study was that those in the primary arm were dosed 37% less than those in the control arm. Getting dosed less saves money for the hospital.\\n\\nThe big question is, if those patients were to continue dosing, how much more would their hemoglobin levels drop? No one can say for sure, otherwise this study would be pointless. Unlike the market study which holds hemoglobin levels constant, this P3 study will hold dosing lengths constant, which should, theoretically, drive hemoglobin levels lower the longer you are dosed. For those in the primary arm, instead of being dosed 37% less than the control arm, you will be dosed 50% more than had you been in the market study.\\n\\nIf endpoints meet in the P3 July catalyst, &gt;$7 is my target. Stock is at such a discount due to lawsuit from disgruntled employee accusing management of misconduct, and tricky P2 dose-ranging data results.\\n\\n---\\n\\nGTXI\\n\\nThis is a most interesting scenario. Simply meeting primary endpoints justifies &gt;$10 for Ostarine alone. P3 results due in 3Q, which many pointing to July. I came by the $10 figure with 340k global incidence of NSCLC, 50% of which experience severe weight loss, with a pricing of $50/day ($1500/month), for $1B in global sales. Company thinks US market is worth $750M, so I think the $1B estimate is sufficiently conservative. Combine that revenue estimate with my expectation of a partnership agreement for 30% royalties, and we end up with $10s.\\n\\nHowever, if the OS data, a secondary endpoint, shows statistically significant improvement greater than a month, well I think the revenue prospects just got a whole lot better. The most bullish case would command 70% of the market population (instead of 50%), but it would get priced at least 50% more, and Wall St. is likely to start looking a revenue streams from other indications down the line, which make it a buyout target. So, in light of that, I think if we saw a 1 month increase in OS, statistically significant, we may see &gt;&gt;$13. I think odds of meeting primary endpoints is pretty rock solid given P2 data, so the real story is what the OS data reveals.\\n\\n---\\n\\nLots of catalysts before October, I'm sure I'll give another update in the future. For now, I will say that VTUS may be a 200% sleeper hit that is being kept down due to $2.5 dilution overhang, catalyst by end of Sept.\",\n",

The closing price of Alpha Bank's common stock on the Athens Stock Exchange on June 13 is €0.473. Logically the ADR should be trading at $0.145. The ADR is trading at a 305% premium over the common stock for no apparent reason.\\n\\nI talked on the phone with a representative of Deutsche Bank, which is the depositary bank for the ADR, to see if there where any developments that I wasn't aware of. The representative confirmed that nothing has changed with the ratio of the ADRs to the common stock and the dividend has already been paid. He also told me that the ADR may be trading at a premium because the books are closed until the rights offering is over.\\n\\nUnless there is some information that I can't think of then the ADR should fall by about 75% if the price of the common stock doesn't change a lot.\\n\\nAn investor could short the ADR and buy the common stock on a 4/1 ratio expecting for the difference to close soon and make a very healthy profit with no risk.\\n\\nDisclosure: I am short ALBKY.PK.

Thorough analysis below:\\n\\nThe CEO, Jeff Krupka, can be reached at 303-469-3051. Link for the OTC Market contact: http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/NXHZ/company-info\\n\\nThe .15 Earnings Per Share (EPS) as the latest EPS for NXHZ sounds like a fair assessment. If they secure the acquisition from shares already existing as like how the CEO already mentioned, then this means that a .15 EPS is derived on the presumption that the OS was maxed out to its Authorized Shares (AS) amount of 250 Million shares as a worst case scenario (although confident that it won’t happen here) and also presuming that out of the $100 Million in ”uranium” reserves, only 37.5% will be immediately captured resulting in $37,500,000 for a Net Income amount to get the .15 EPS that you mentioned as indicated below... \\n\\n$37,500,000 ÷ 250,000,000 (Maxed OS) = .15 EPS \\n\\nIf they partner with a major company as like has been mentioned, then I would give the life of the Gold Eagle Mine a 5 year life span to capture the reserves. This means that I would take that .15 EPS and divide it by 5 years to equate to basically an EPS of .03 per share. \\n\\nHere’s where it can get a little tricky because now to derive the fundamental share price of where NXHZ should trade from the closure of this huge ”uranium” deal, we must multiply the EPS by a Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio. There are a few different ways to logically derive what P/E Ratio to use, but I like to use what’s ”officially” indicated within the Yahoo Finance database for the ”Industry” of which a stock would trade. NXHZ has a $100 Million deal for ”uranium” confirmed by the Department of Energy (DOE) as indicated within the link below: \\nhttp://www.nexhorizoninfo.com/# \\n\\nThe P/E Ratio is the growth rate for stocks/companies within a sector or industry that are generating revenues/Income/profits. These companies are used as the standard for other companies to be measured upon to determine the rate of its growth. With the indicated P/E Ratio below from Yahoo Finance… it is what it is. It is not speculative or something that I made up. It is confirmed from an official database of registered stocks that trades within that Industry/Sector. I think it is important to read the link/post below to understand the different concepts for interpreting a P/E Ratio before reading any further: \\nhttp://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=57154170 \\n\\nWith a ”uranium” deal of this magnitude, NXHZ would trade within the Industry called Industrial Metals &amp; Minerals within the Sector called Basic Materials as with the likes of companies such as Cameco, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, Vale, and many others: \\nhttp://biz.yahoo.com/p/133mktd.html \\n\\nThe Industrial Metals &amp; Minerals Industry has a 73.40 P/E Ratio. This means that 73.40 is the Growth Rate to be used as the multiple with the EPS of .03 per share to determine where NXHZ should fundamentally trade upon securing this ”uranium” deal as indicated: \\n\\n73.40 P/E Ratio x .03 EPS = **$2.20 Share Price** \\n\\nFor those reading this post, please understand that this post is not what will dictate if NXHZ will actually trade at the above derived valuation of $2.20 per share. The company’s actions will dictate such. If a year goes by and we are still here waiting on the news, then please understand that it is everyone’s own responsibility to trade accordingly. I can’t control when and what news will be released. \\n\\nHowever, if the news of the $100 Million acquisition confirmed by the DOE is released as soon as some of us have been expecting, then the above thoughts could be used as a framework to possibly get an idea of where NXHZ should be fundamentally trading. If they capture much more than the 37.5% of the $100 million uranium reserves that was used to derive this valuation, then use the substitution property to make the necessary adjustments. Personally, I love the ”risk versus rewards” existing here with NXHZ, but at the very least, I think NXHZ is worthy of being kept on watch by all as the CEO has mentioned that they are in the process of providing audited financials through filing a Super 10K, specifically, a combined filing of annual reports for calendar years 2010, 2011, 2012, and portions of year 2013 as PRed below: \\nhttp://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&amp;article=57228023&amp;symbol=NXHZ \\n\\nThe Uranium News can be read below for those who have not seen it yet: \\nhttp://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/NXHZ/news \\n',\n",

       " \"Hope some of you got in on that sweet bounce, especially if you were holding through the catalyst like me. Results were surprising, I guess the proportion of UK patients were high, they don't use TOBI as much in the UK... Low historical use of TOBI explains over-performance in the trial (in the American Cayston vs TOBI trial, TOBI never exceeded 1% improvement), but the low performance from Arikace was surprising. That's the importance of conducting a truly blind P2 study. I suspect patients had a decent idea of whether or not they were on Arikace, and that may explain the good P2 data. On a longer study Arikace may have surpassed TOBI, but for the purpose of approval that isn't necessary. An easier treatment regime and non-inferiority data is sufficient for approval in the markets. 75% of those enrolled sub-sequentially went into the 2 year study... That data will now be the determining factor for whether or not Arikace (for CF) is a &lt;$200M revenue inhaler to &gt;$400M.\\n\\nFor the time being, INSM is still underpriced even with my revenue expectations for the CF indication at a mere $100M (being a small cap biotech company and all), and the NTM indication at 30% to-market odds. NTM is definitely still the main value driver for the company, especially after today's announcement of QIPD and FTD. Both of those will give Arikace more exclusivity in the market in NTM, and speed up the regulatory process. If Arikace shows rigorous enough data in the upcoming P2 results for NTM, it will be sufficient for approval. In such an event, stock will be worth, at least, mid-high $20s until approved. There is a tremendous market for inhaled Arikace in this indication that is already using a more toxic injected form of Arikace.\\n\\nMSTX, RMTI, and GTXI, are the next expected catalysts. All of them would collapse farrr more than 15% in the event of trial failure, keep that in mind.\\n\\nRMTI is definitely the high risk, high reward play. GTXI not as likely to fail, but unlike RMTI, there are degrees of success... Meeting primary endpoint is one thing, but showing stat sig OS improvement is another. MSTX may move to 65c, but it won't hold it for long.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Take it as a blessing that you got information that is currently behind a paywall. The results may very well come back positive and now the upside is even more incredible for longs, but my thesis relied on minimal chance of failure, and, minimal chance of collapsing to pre-run-up prices in the $3s. It's no longer worth it for me. As I said in the past, the upside was heavily dependent on OS endpoint even if primary endpoint was met... Now that primary endpoint success odds aren't so certain, the R:R is no longer there.\\n\\nI totally missed the use of mean in the P2, but not in the P3. However, that one simple fact may not have deterred me because the additional data presented in that AF article is behind a paywall. TBH, this is the first time I've knowingly suffered a loss that may have been prevented had I looked at paid-for information... I guess I'll be keeping a closer eye for such opportunities in the future.\\n\\nIf the P3 trial used the mean method of calculation, the bull thesis might still be intact because there is a chance those outliers would carry GTXI through again... But it doesn't, it uses percentage of responders. How good the outliers do is no longer a factor. Further, in a much larger trial, the chances that GTXI gets favorable randomization is far less.\\n\\nOf course, outlier could simply be another word for responder. But since the P3 responder endpoint will significantly reduce the impact of outliers on the trial results, and because this wasn't the only subset in the P2 trial, I would be very wary of success potential.\\n\\nI'm still learning how to better spot both post-hoc bullshit, and the misuse of interpreting mean data in the presence of impactful outliers in a small control arm that had randomly been destined to fare worse than the small treatment arm.\\n\\nTwitter is fucking awesome for biotech. Recently AF published an article on VNDA that made it tank. AF had been hinting past 24 or so hours that he was writing a big piece that also looked at clinical data like his VNDA one. When he made his tweet that he was about to publish today's article, I only had to see the headline to exit. I actually yelled fuck when I read the headline, lol. Didn't play any bounce, as this article isn't a conclusion for the P3 story, which means shorts aren't going to start exiting en mass. Short cover is the major instigator for bounces, and I can't rely on enough long bounce players to make it happen on their own. It could continue to bleed. Often times AF bear articles are off-based, focused on managements or historical company performance, and will bounce, but I don't trust a bounce up here, not after such a thorough article focused on clinical data.\\n\\nThere's a lot to learn in the biotech world, so whenever you lose money (and even when you make money), learn from it! You will often be bearish or bullish for the wrong reasons... Just because you end up being on the right side of the bet doesn't mean your argument was correct.\\n\\nRMTI reporting results tomorrow morning. If you're observant, they used mean in the P2 aswell. However, KERX, working in a similar indication, used mean in their trials, and RMTI is using mean again in the P3. Further, it reported positive PRIME results, which strongly suggested that the drug, at the P3 dose, is doing something effectively. The P2 data was quite contentious, but at the 10ug dose, it did meet the P3 endpoint of mean change in Hgb. Hopefully I can cover today's losses tomorrow, but, the way I see it, I dodged a big bullet today\",\n",

       " \"Probably a pointless exercise :)\\n\\nThe trial has finished enrollment for 3.5 years,  the chances that A-7 arm doesn't statistically significantly outperform control arm, by a large margin, would be very slim, if the target death rate was &lt;300.\\n\\nLongs are convinced that design of trial, and initial impressions from management comments, imply that the target death rate was &lt;300, probably 275-285, when trial began +6 years ago.\\n\\nMy concern is that there is no consequence for management to increase target death rate, if the target death rate did in fact start in the smaller range. The FDA could not give 2 fucks if company decided to wait for more mature data... They constantly get pissed off when companies prematurely unblind trial. FDA is not going to hold company accountable to breaking the SPA's target death event when the goal post for judging cancer treatments has changed more times than I care to count since. If management had prematurely unblinded trial when goal post had been moved, the FDA has no problem flipping them off and telling them to do it again.\\n\\nThe problem is that the chances of successful results, or at least marketable results, if target death rate is 325 or more, is very fucking fleeting.\\n\\nYou may ask, why would management increase the target death rate? Well, why do a lot of dead or failing companies do the shit they do? To justify their payroll for several more years while they find some other drug develop for the next half decade? Maybe when trial enrollment finished 3.5 years ago, they saw Yervoy and Zalboraf options on the horizon and thought that maybe if they prolonged trial, the A-7 arm may benefit disproportionately with respect to the control arm and result in an extended survival tail to make HR look good? Maybe they hoped that by the time trial ends, the standards will have changed to weighing the importance of HR above mOS if major synergy did occur with Yervoy and Zalboraf?\\n\\nWhatever the case may be IF they had increased the target death rate, the possibility does make me reluctant to place a bet in this company. Then of course there is the possibility that the target death rate was higher to begin with, but that simply doesn't chive with the spirit of what management has been telling investors since the beginning.\\n\\nIt is quite amusing that in the span of when this trial was designed, to now, the way the FDA judges cancer treatments has gone from responders (what this trial was designed for), progression free survival, and now it's overall survival. Back when they started trial, immunotherapy was not that hot and may explain the slow enrollment.\\n\\nIt would be an absolute shocker if target death rate were 275-285, because the mOS would be doubled at least in the A-7 arm, and HR likely &lt;0.5 even after &gt;3.5 years worth of matured survival data. An absolute shocker, almost too good to be true, but there is a case to be made that trial design was in fact &lt;285 target death events.\\n\\nQuite the pickle longs are in. If management came out with the figure tomorrow, market would react as if results were out because the trial duration has been so long that you can immediately derive the obvious conclusion based off the target death event number.\\n\\nSo in the end, the question is, what's more likely:\\n\\n* Has this sleeper of a blockbuster vaccine skirted beneath the nose of the oncology world to finally come out with &gt;&gt;50% increase in mOS?\\n\\n* Is target death event high enough so that the trial takes forever to reach it because there are always a proportion of patients who are still living for +3 years even in an indication as deadly as this one?\\n\\nSmart money says second scenario, and the lack of disclosing the target death event number isn't a bullish sign. So, convince me otherwise!\",\n",

I hope some of you guys who may have gambled on move to 5-6 unloaded some when it failed 6 test. Cruise-2 results are a shoe-in with a p value of 0.011. Cacitrol decision after Aug likely (6 mo review), and CRUISE-2 in Sept.\\n\\nGTXI is interesting now. Adam Feurstein fucked up his analysis of the Lancelot article w/ is behind a paywall. AF said there were no listed baseline mean values for stairclimb power. That is true, but was listed was the median values and range. For instance, the median baseline for placebo was over 72.8, with the lowest value being 72.8 watts. AF \"calculated\" mean value for placebo baseline to be 46 watts, which is fundamentally impossible if all the values are over 72.8 watts. He then compared it to his mean value for experimental arm which was equally flawed but came out to 80 watts. So when market read AF article and he said baseline wildly favored experimental arm performance, 46 watts vs 80 watts, they correctly doubted significance of stairclimb improvement comparisons. AF left out the median and range data in his article, which came from behind a paywall. It was only until critics of his impossible math calculations posted the baseline data table that the bullshit became clear. What is true is that the placebo arm was sicker in the lung cancer subset, but it is not likely to be on the scale of 46 vs 80 when recently published data from Co specified that baselines for all subsets (lung and other cancers) were 160s in placebo vs 150s in experimental. As such, I will be revisiting the bull side for GTXI. I think market has started to digest bullshit past few days and this sinking ship may stay afloat afterall. Results within 3 weeks prly.\\n\\nVICL is looking better to me w/ every passing day. If target death rate is 300 or below, there is over an 80% chance of statistically significant improvement to mOS. So what is target death count? Well, I figured out a decent method using Co\\'s initial projections for trial result release, combined with Co\\'s initial expected survival expectations for both arms, to come to a reasonable conclusion that the target is between 260-305. If there were no crossover allowed, this trial would have probably concluded last summer, but because Yervoy and Zalboraf were approved last year, it is possible that remaining survivors, long since past the 2 year trial duration (permitting crossover after 2yrs) could have lived longer than expected for the past year. Either way, I suspect the death rate is 300 or lower. \\n\\nMy big question is that the data used to derive the odds of statistically significant results based on known trial duration (3.5yrs since last enrollee) and target death counts, may not have accounted for possible confounding of past 12mo data due to new therapies. As a result, that &gt;80% figure from the recent SA article given target death rate of 300 or less, may be flawed. I could be completely wrong about method used by the author of those data points, but I have not yet tried to convince myself of how it could be flawed, more on that in cpl days. I suspect results after mid-Aug so I got 2-3 weeks to see if I can develop a model to do the same thing but ignore last 12 months to come up with a possibly more accurate prediction for the mOS in both arms. \\n\\n2nd issue is trial took so long that HR data &gt;2yrs may be confounded by newly approved therapies that would be assessible by larger proportion of longer living experimental arm. I am not entirely certain of trial protocols, so more on that later when I follow up on whether SA article\\'s % chance of success is flawed.',\n",
